People wonder why hesitancy and feel our best  opportunity lies with bill for partnership. Will be difficult  to explain why no bill offered. We urge consideration of  administration bill which would force identification of those  opposed. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/0	0	1.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1.pdfpage

Curtis  Mayor of the City of Orofino  Orofino, Idaho  Dear Bert:  I have your letter of April 29. enclosing a letter from Senator  Dworshak and excerpts from General Sturgis' testimony. The Senator  sent me a copy of this same material.  I believe General Sturgis did not mean that the private companies  were not interested in building the power plant. 1 think he intended to  say that he doubted the private companies could build the entire project  unless they could receive benefits from the downstream storage. which.  of course, under the law could not be done at the present time.  There is considerable discussion going on in Washington, D. C. as  to the type of bill to be introduced. 1 think the majority of the Adrninistra­.......  tion is inclined toward a bill for government construction of the dam and  V a period of time - one or one-half years - to work out provisions with  local interests to build. own, and operate the power facilities. We have  advised them that we would be interested in this proposal since it would  permit much earlier construction than probably would Occur if we waited  for legislation to permit us to do the whole job and secure the downstream  benefits plus a contribution from the government for the flood control and  navigation features.  1 am in hopes that the Senator will decide to introduce this kind of  a bill at a rather early date so that it may have a chance of getting through  this session of Congress. This, I think, would eli.m.i.nate also a lot of the  fish problem, as the govermnent can do many things that a private company  would find hard to do.  I am returning the enclosures as 1 have copies of this material. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/2	2	3.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/3.pdfpage

Dear General Sturgis:  I have recently heard that a bill will soon be introduced  to authorize Bruce's Eddy and Penny Cliffs project on the Clear­water  River in Idaho.  li.ited information 1 have received indicates that the Army  desires to build with po~er facilities and transmission lines  developed by the Pacific ~orthwest Power Company, which utility  will pay the government Cor the use of water.  We have strongly supported these two projects in the past  and feel thal it is i.perative that Congress be urged to take  i.mediate favorable action.  I would very much appreciate any information you can give  me as to whether or not I have been correctly informed and in­formation  as to how soon this legislation may get to Congress.  The strongest support possible will come from this area for the  proposal and should a rough draft of the bill be available, we  would certainly appreciate the opportunity to look it over.

I am sure that our  folks will enjoy looking at this picture.  For your confidential information. and I doubt that it  should be discussed very much at this time, I understand  that the Army may very well introduce a bill in this session  of Congress authorizing both Penny Cliffs and Bruces Eddy  projects for partnership construction. While I have not had  direct information on this, it is from a fairly reliable source.  I shall be in Washington again in the next couple of weeks  and I think I will be able to get a little more information. It  may be advisable in the long run to let the federal government  build the dams and have the Pacific Northwest Power Company  build the power plants and transmission facilities. This would  eliminate a lot of delay in connection with these projects. 1  will let you know about anything definite that 1 get in this con·  nection.

This bill does not quite fit the situation that we had hoped to develop.  I have gone over other bills on partnership and none of them quite work  out with the program we had in mind.  I am returning the bill in connection with Trinity River. and am  also enclosing House bill H. R. 4662. which is the bill now before  Congress in connectioD with the Cougar Dam and the Green Peter Dam,  in Oregon. Both of these have been approved for federal construction  and an attempt is being made to change that program to one where the  federal government will build and operate the dams and reservoirs, and  local units - the City of Eugene in one case, and Pacific Power &. Light  Company in the other, would build the power facilities under a license  from the Federal Power Commission.  I am leaving for Portland ton ight and expect to see the attorneys  for the Pacific Northwest Power Company. I will ask them to draft  the provisions which we think should be in the bill and which we believe  the Army Engineers are agreeable to.

Honorable nnis Chavez R£C'O JU \955  Cha A, ~ Ittee on PublIC Works  oited Sta es Senate  Wasl&gt;lngto , D.C.  Dear Wr. Cbairman:  I all trans"l tt i ng hereei th, a re" rt dated 25 Apr i I 1955,  froe the Chief of Inglneers, Depar nt of the ArIlY, together  eith accoepanying papers and i ~ustratlons, on Widdle Snake  River, Snake River and Tributaries, .yoeing, Idaho, Oregon  and eshington. This inves11~ation eas requested by a resolu­tion  of the Co.. ittee on Public Yorks, United States Senate,  adopted on 5 October 1951. The Bur""4f the Budget has ad­vised  that ehlle thate would be no objectt~ to the sub.lssion  of the proposed report of the Chief of Engineers to the Congress,  authorization for complete Federal developllent of the Bruces  Eddy end PeRhy Cl iffs projects eould AOt be in accorclwith the  pr09ra• • f the President until the possibilities of 10c~1 par­ticIpation  have been fully explored. The complete viees of the  Bureau of the Budget are contained in the attached copy of its  letter.  II  In view of the fect that a large proportion of the benefits  of the projects consist of flood control benefits and of bene­fits  to downstrea. Federal da.s, the Chief of Engineers con­siders  that construction of aithar project as a whole is un­likely  to be financially profitable for aay licensae unless  sOlie forll of Federal financial participation Is authorized.  ~ A partnership arrange ent, under which the Federal Govern­Ilent  eould build the da. and non-Federal Interests the po.er  facilities, could be developed so as to conforll ganerally to  prev ious 1y proposed partnersh ip plans. Th i s eou 1d be accom­plished  by legislation essantially sl.ilar to H. R. 4662 for  the Cougar and Green Peter projects. Under this arrangement,  the participating company eould finance the entire cost of the  project allocated to production of power at site. There is  one basic difference beteeen the Cougar and Graen Peter pro­jects  and the Clearwater Basin projects now undar consideration.  The operetion of the latter Ilust be coordinated closely with  downstrea. plants In order to obtain the maxillu. advantage for  the region as a whole, in viee of the very large doenstrea.  power benefits which can be obtained. This relationship re­quires  a sub-allocation of allocated poeer costs for the Bruces  Eddy project between at-site power and Federal downstrea. power.

I, of course, did not ql.e tbe source of any ot  ay informatioD. nor did I discuss any ot the pertinent detail. I know it  ~ll be beartening to you to know tbat tbis organization, with its wide  representation in Oregon end asbington I18de up of both pl1bl1c and private  power advocates, are all out In strong lupport ot the Clearwater develop­ment.  I think we have sold tbea our else. principally because of tbe  navigation benefits whicb exist in the Aruce's Eddy and Penny Cliffs pro­jects.  It il bard to re8li~e how strongly these people down the maJn ste.  of the Columbia River desire naVigation benefitS. 1:l!hen ttley can see ttD t  the Clearwater projects will make Ice Harbor and other downstream locatioDs  more feasible. they will work endlessly for OUT projects. Among some ot  those that I discussed this with and I think you know it 11 Ctlarles RAker  of Walla Walla. rresident of the I.E.I.A. Baker is • strong rublie rower  advocate. but alia 8 great leader for na.igation in the interests of his  wheat growers and Carmer organizations along tbe Columbia. !bose fellows  really wish to ship their wheat by barge and will work for anything in  tbe .8Y at upltreu storage.

Generally speaking. tberetes a very stroD~ feeline of orti~i6.  and .igbty strong support rr~ all tbe organizations throuohout the region.  We all feel tblt it is i~r.tive for early consideration. With the Clear­water  Ind lower !'nake lJutborizatloD. ttle "{OJ 11 Callyon issue can well be ror­gotte.  be!ore tbe 1956 campaign. aDd this to me is an i~ortant reason why  our republican adminiltration must yo forward at every opportunity to show  tbat it is tbe plrty tor progresl and development •  • 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/35	35	36.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/36.pdfpage

BIA RIVER NAVIQATION  Mr. NEUBERGER. Mr. President.  the Hoover Commission Is making 50  many assaults upon urgent and impor­tant  functions of Government that It Is  hard to keep pace with these attacks.  However, I should like to voice some brief  comments on the latest Hoover Com­mission  proposal tor wrecking Impera­tive  Federal services. Many of my con­sUtuents  join In these comments.  Mr. Hoover and his aides have recom­mended  that user charges be levied on  waterways Improved with Government  funds. This would npply to water com­merce  passing through Jooks such as  those at Bonneville and McNary Danu  on the Columbia River. and, I presume,  to water naVigation made possible by  channel deepening on such river systems  as the Missouri and the Willamette.  Superficially. Mr. President, I imagine  that the Hoover suggestions make sense  to a great many people. Why should  not barges. tugs. stern-wheelers and  freighters pay to pass through Govern­ment  locks on great Inland water routes  like the Columbia and MississippI?  Yet, we must remember that. since the  era of George Washington. the Govern­ment  has dredged, deepened, and marked  with buoys our Interior waterways,  These were the first great routes of em­pire,  It was the Missouri and then the  Columbia River system which took Lewis  and Clark westbound across the conti­nent  with our fiag, 150 years ago.  Free access through Government locks  has provided a yardstick to help bring  down freight tolls on the railroads and  the big trucklines, Where there has  been water competition In the Pacific  Northwest. for example, the charges to  our farmers for transporting wheat.  orchard fruits. and general produce are  far cheaper than In areas where no water  navigation exists.  Think of what Government Improve­ments  have meant In my region. In  1933, befol'e construdlon of BonnevllIe  Dam by the Corps of Army Engineers.  only 65,715 tons of cargo passed Into  the upper Columbia at Cascade Rapids.  By 1953. two decades later, this had  soared to 1,343,575 tons-an Increase of  a phenomenal 1,600 percent. What had  made the dllference? It was the high_  lift locks installed in Bonneville Dam.  where also vast Quantities of low-cost  hydroelectric power have been generated  for the farms, homes, and factories of  our region.  Now. the Hoover Commission would  rule out such gains. by applying heavy  water-u,&lt;;er tolls to use of the Bonneville  locks. This is done in the name of that  old Hoover cliche that those who receive  Government services should pay for  them,  How plausible Ihls sounds, Mr. PresI_  dent. How logical It seems, Mr, Presl­dfnt.  But. Mr. President. who would dare  apply this doctrine to our daily lives?  Would we say that only the people with  chlidren In the school ages should pay  school taxes? Would we apply the cruel  and grim rule that a man with 6 chil_  dren would pay 6 times as heavy a school  tax as a father with 1 child? Would we  exempt families with no children from  all payment at school taxes?  What a mockery this would make of  our educational system In America.  Suppose a man had a fire In his house.  Would we blll him $250 the next after_  noon for turning out the hook-and-lad_  del' truck to quell the fire? Is that not  what the Hoover theories mean? Those  who receive Government services should  pay for them, Why should a man whose  house Is not on fire pay taxes to douse the  fiames in the house of another man?  Move on to the realm of law enforce_  ment. If a famlly reQuires the protec_  tion of several policemen because the  family has been Invaded by some lawless  marauder, should we blil that famlly  for the patrolmen's wages? What pos­sible  good could come to a civilized so~  ciety from such a harsh and savage doc­trine?  Yet. Mr. PI·esldent. this Is What might  occur If we tollow through on the Hoover  doctrIne that those who receive Govern_  ment services should be the only people  to pay for them.  In this connection, I ask unanimous  consent to Include In the body of the  RECORD three Informative articles on the  newest recommendations at the Hoover  Commission, by Alan S, Emory, who Is  the Washington correspondent of a fear_  less and enlightened dally newspaper in  upstate New York, the watertown Dally  Times,  Mr. Emory's articles were published  June 10, 11, and 12, 1955.  There being no objection, the articles  were ordered to be printeclln the RECORD,  as follows:  [From the Watertown (N. Y.) Dally Times  of June lCl.195S]  Uan. CHARt:U URt:E(l ON UNITED STAn:s-AmEll  WATJ;RWAYS-Hoovt:R'a AND E&lt;at:NHown's  QRQura ALso TO AOVOCATI: SHARINC OF COaT!  (By Alan S. Emory)  WA!HINCTON. June 9.-Both the Hoover  Commission and the President's Special  Committee on Water Resources will recom.  mend user charges on federally aided water_  ways, It WIUI learned today,  WOULD SPAlt: CoaTI  The two reports will al80 advocate strongly  the sharing or costs on water projects, with  the formula dependIng on the communlty'l  ablllt}· to p(ly, the size of the community or  State and the scope ot the proJect,  Both features are u~ted to provide hoat_  ed debate In the halls of Congress.  The user charge proposal Is an outgrowth  of II. pion to charge tolls on waterways built  with Federal funds. This plan, origInally  pllrt of the report by the President'l Com.  mlttu on Transportatlon, was strIcken after  Its premature relellle aroused aubstlintlal  opposition.  The tint draft, tavored strongly by Stcre·  tary of Detell$l! Charles E. W!l8On, would have  let the tolls sUmclently high to repay the  Government for every penny It had ever In_  "utU In wster projects. Th1a was later  modi ned.  Informed sources saId the President want_  ed hl~ Water Resources Committee report  IUbmltted before the Hoover Commission'.  80 he would have a pO$ltlon trom which to  comment on prOpcl6llls by the Independent  agency. This was the time tor the traIll&gt;­portatlon  euggestlons.  But contronrsy haa postponed the Presi_  dent'. commlt~ project. At first It had  been requested for Ula In the state of the  Union address,  More recently tt was presented to the  President, but he reportedly rejeeted It as  too vague In defining policy and demanded  II more po$ltlve Itatement. Under secretary  ot the InterJor Clarence A. DaVia W(l& sup­posed  to brief the report before the Natlonal  RII'ers and Harbors Congress laat week, but  he confeued that the SUbject ot hll speech  "Is the occasion ot some little embllrrass·  ment." The report "",un't resdy, although  It Is due soon.  The lubject matter ot the Hoover Com­mlulon's  task force report on water re·  eourcell-slthough part ot the power section  haa leaked out-II 80 closely guarded that  members slated to addreu the American  Society ot Clvll Engineers In St. Loull June  1.5 do not yet know what they clln say.  W. W. Horner, St. Louis consultlng engi_  neer and chairman ot the flood-control task  eubgroup, feels that ae ot now he cannot say  anything.  The Commission hllll eet Saturday for a  meeting, at which time the St.Lou1a speeches  may be c1e8l,:ed,  Because of the complel: lind controversial  Jl;ature ot the water resources report-rele.....  of Which haa been demanded In Congreas­Chairman  Herbert Hoover has not seleeted.  the three Comm".sloners to draw up the  unll's linal waler resourcel report.  • •  The Prnldent'l cabinet Committee snd  Adm. Bell Moreell, chairman of the water  reaourcu tuk torce of the Hoover Commls_  aion, have been In contact severlll times. Ind  there have been conferences between the two  &tatrs.  A pattern ot policy "..11\ be set by the two  reporte And by the water re80urcea regula­tlone  laid down by the Bureau or the Budget.

RoelNllON, ..'u:.'c&gt; ....T  May 24, 1956  The Honorable A. B. Curtis  Mayor of the City of Orofino  Orofino. Idaho  Dear Bert:  I have your letter of May 23 enclosing the letter you  received from Senator Dworshak.  I do not yet quite understand what Henry has in mind.  I was unable to find the Trinity Dam Bill but. as I remember it.  it was one of these bills where the Bureau of Reclamation was  to work out a plan with a private utility and then bring it back  to Congress for approval. This, of course, is a very cumber-some  process and almost like giving the Army federal authorization  to build the projects. I am sure that if the Army Engineers and  the Bureau of the Budget include Bruces Eddy in the omnibus bill,  with a recommendation that a period of time be given for working  out partnership construction, that the Public Works Committee  will look upon it with more favor than Henry feels that it would.  1 was told yesterday that at least some of the leaders in  Congress say that they are not going to authorize anything on the  Clearwater until such time as the court decision has been rendered  in the Idaho Power Company case and such congressional investigations  as may be started in connection with the same matter have been com­pleted.  So possibly nothing will be done about the Clearwater in this  session of Congress if my information is correct. However. I think  we should make every effort to have Henry do what he can if these  projects should be included in the omnibus bill.  Sincerely,  1Y;m.~  R.w 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/79	79	80.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/80.pdfpage

Curtis  Mayor of the City of Orofino  Orofino, Idaho  Dear Bert:  1 have your letter of May 31, 1956 enclosing a copy of  the Trinity Dam Bill.  This bill has a couple of provisions which 1 think would  be very serious. The first is the llProvided" section in paragraph  I, requiring that the Secretary of Interior recommend proposals  for the sale of falling water "which agreement, if any. shall not  become effective until approved by Congress. tl  The second provision is in Section 4 of the bill, in the first  IIProvided'l section: I1That a first preference, to the extent of  Z5 per centum of such additional energy, shall be given, under  reclamation law, to preference customers II  The first provision I think would probably foreclose us from  ever getting congressional authorization in a congress such as we  have today, which may not be any better in the coming congressional  year.  The provision in Section 4 of the bill would make it impossible  for us to finance a dam if we had to allocate any of the power to  preference customers.  1 am sure that the bill you presented to Senator Dworshak is  much cleaner and has a greater opportunity of securing approval.

By _ Committee  TO THE HONORABLE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE  UN lTED STATES IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED:  We, your memorialists, the Legislature of the State of  Idaho, respectfully represent, that:  WHEREAS, the Army Corp of Engineer1s 308 Review, properly  denominated as House Document No. 531, Eighty-first Congress,  Second Session, as the same has been later amended and modified  by Senate Document No. 51, Eighty-fourth Congress, First Session  and review of House Document No. 531, dated June, 1958 entitled  Water Resource Development Columbia River Basin, clearly points  out that the site of the proposed storage dam on the North Fork  of the Clearwater River in Clearwater County, state of Idaho,  known as Brucets Eddy, is a great natural location for a multi­purpose  flood control and hydroelectric dam installation; and,  WHEREAS J Federal funds approaching $2,000,000 in amount  have been expended on studies, explorations, surveys, testing  and planning of said project, the results of which have fully  supported the original recommendation of the Army Corp of  Engineers as contained in the above referenced documents, and J  WHEREAS J annual flood damage of considerable proportion  exists on the Clearwater River J where a recurrence of the 1948  flood in the Clearwater valleYJ based on present conditions,  -1- 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/117	117	118.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/118.pdfpage

Flood Control. Local flood damage in the Clearwater  Basin would be reduced annually and major flood problems in  the lower Columbia River would be importantly benefited by  upstream storage as would be provided by this proposed project.  2. Power. A Bruce's Eddy power plant would have, at  site, an ultImate power installation in excess of 500,000  kilowatts. In addition, storage releases from Bruce's Eddy  reservoir would increase the energy generation at downstream  power plants by 799,000,000 kilowatt hours annually. That the  benefit to cost ratio of said project, as estimated in Senate  Document 51, would be 2.14 to 1.  -2- 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/118	118	119.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/119.pdfpage
Page 3									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														/  3. Navigation. The Bruce's Eddy pool would provide im­portant  assistance in transportation of logs from the furests  to the mills which would yield an estimated benefit of $537,000  annually.  4. Storage. The reservoir at the project would provide  about 2,000,000 acre feet of usable water storage.  5. Recreation. The reservoir would be about 50 miles long  and will provide many and varied recreational benefits to the  people of the State of Idaho;  NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the State  of Idaho, the House of Representatives concurring, that we  most respectfully urge upon the Congress of the United States  of America that Congress expedite such legislation as shall be  reqUired to the end that construction of the Bruce1s Eddy Dam  project on the North Fork of the Clearwater River in Idaho shall  be authorized and construction be commenced at an early date.  BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of the State of  Idaho be authorized, and he hereby is directed, to immediately  forward certified copies of this Memorial to the Senate and  House of Representatives of the United States of America, to  the Federal Power Commission, to the Secretary of Interior,  and to the Senators and Representatives in Congress from this  State and from the States of Montana, Washington and Oregon. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/119	119	120.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/120.pdfpage

Curtis  Orofino, Idaho  Dear Bert:  COMMITTUON  INTDtIOR ANI) INSULl''' ~-"I".  May 22, 1962  It was thoughtful of you to send me a copy of a letter you  received from Colonel James Beddow regard1ng details related to the  construction of Bruces Eddy Dam.  I regret that although I have been extremely active 1n getting  the funds for pre-construction engineering for this project, I have not  been much concerned about details which are largely supervised by  the Army Corps of Engineers. I am sure that you are taking the proper  steps to work out some of the problems 1n advance and avoid contro­versy  which may impede progress when construction finally starts.  We will face some difficulty in getting authorization, and I  have not been disturbed by the necessity of getting construction  funds. If authorization comes late this session it may be impossible  to get a Budget Bureau request for funds, but I have assurances from  Chairman Ellender that enough construction funds will be made avail­able  for the prel1minary work under the construction program. Usually  such projects get off to a rather slow start, but funds are forthcoming  to carry on as rapidly as work can be done efficiently.  The enclosed copy of testimony before our Appropriations  Subcommittee on Public Works may be of interest to you. We need  not be concerned about getting approval of this project in the Senate,  but I am still in doubt about whether the wildlife groups will be able  to prevent authorization on the House side. That is where the work  must be done.  Best wishes. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/126	126	127.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/127.pdfpage
Page 2									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														TRANSCRIPT OF REMARKS BETWEEN SENATOR HENRY DWORSHAK AND  HERBERT G. W&ST, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, INlAND EMPIRE  WATERWAYS ASSOCIATION;SUBCOMMITTEE ON PUBLIC  WORKS OF THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS  MAY 17, 1962  SENATOR DvVORSHAK. I understand, Mr. West, that your statement -  includes an unqualified endorsement of the Sruees Eddy project on the  North Fork of the Clearwater River.  MR. VlEET. Yes.  SENATOR DWORSHAK. And I note also that you are asking for  $3,300,000 for beginning construction. Of course, our first roadblock 1s to  secure the authorization.  MR. WEST. That is right.  SENATOR DWORSHAK. I think that In the up-dating of the 30B report  the Army Engineers and the Budget Bureau have recommended authorization of  this project.  MR. WEST. That is right. And that is In the process, Senator, it has  been reported to the House. No hearing date has been set, but we are very  hopeful of being able to Include that 30B review report In the omnibus authori­zation  bill. And of course I know that the Committee will not make an  appropriation without the authorization, but we won't be here at that time, so  you are right, we want toca11 that to the attention of the Committee.  SENATOR DWORSHAK. I understand that the Senate wUl not act on the  omnibus bUI until after the House completes action, which means that it may  be very late in the Session before the omnibus bill clears Congress.  MR. WEST. That is right.  SENATOR DWORSHAK. And therefore it may be quite late to get a Budget  request for construction funds I although in view of the fine support, bi-partisan  support we have received from this committee and from the Northwest Delegations  on Bruces Eddy over the past four years, and getting the reconstruction  engineering work authorized, at the present time a total of $2,600,000 has been  appropriated and ma:l e available, which I understand will complete the surveying  and the preconstruction work on this project. 1 think that that will run until  the end of this fiscal year I with only about s 1x weeks remaining, and the Army  Engineers have testified that the project \"411 be ready for construction.  MR. W&ST. That is right, sir.  SENATOR MAGNUSON. I think we ought to add, Senator Dworshak, that  if we do get the authorization in time, that we are all in gens-al agreement that  we ought to make the attempt to get this money.  SENATOR DWORSHAK. Yes, I have discussed this with Chairman Ellender  of this Subcom!""littee, and as an ardent supporter over the years he Is in accord  with that proposal, I might say, to save a year by getting some construction  funds in the Bill in this Session.  SENATOR MAGN USON • Yes.  SENATOR DWORSHAK. I also wanted to make the observation that whlle  in the past four or five years there has been considerable opposition to this  project, especially by fish and wlldl1fe groups, who felt that io adequate  attention was being given to the fish and wildlife aspects of this project, that  this opposition seems to have vanished largely because in the past few years  we have been able to get, I think, about $2 million to conduct fish and wilflife  surveys in the middle Snake area, to ascertain the possible damages which  might result from the buUding of this high dam on the North Fork of the Clearwater  River.  And just last month we received in the Senate Appropriations Committee a  report from the Federal Fish and Wlldl1fe Service recommending the buUdlng  of a fish hatchery near Kooskia, which would serve to replenish and propagate  fish, particularly salmon and steelhead, in the reservoir, and in the various  streams in that area.  MR. 'JIIEST. That is right, sir.  SENATOR DWORSHAK. I offered that amendment a year ago with  instructions to the Fish and V.lildlife Service to make the report in April, which  was done. And under those circumstances I and the extensive surveys and  studies which have been conducted for several years, I would say unequivocally  that the Bruces Eddy project has received more extensive consideration so far 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/127	127	128.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/128.pdfpage

The economic situatiOD in northern Idaho has giYen me  concern for some time, but I am hoping that the Bruces Eddy and  various Qtbe;;rpq~ will get under \l8,y to relieve the distress  in the near ture. It will be good to have you and Ray McNichols  back here for the hearings, \lhich I expect will be scheduled some­time  after the 4th of July.

As I told Ray, senator Church and I have discussed this  Bruces Eddy proposal on several recent occasions and feel fairly  confident of success this year. As a part of the Omnibus Rivers  and lBrbors Bill and with promised backing from the Wh1te Ibuse, it  doesn't seem that I am being overly optimistic to e~ct to over­ride  the opposition in this instance.  I will let you and Ray know later of the hearing dates  and any suggestions which happen to occur to me.

Curtis  Orofino, Idaho  Dear Bert:  fune 27, 1962  This will acknowledge your letter of June 19 inviting me  to join the CleaIWater Tour beginning July 11. You are making the  trip very attractive; and, of course, it would be a real pleasure  for me to join the group. However, it is not likely that I shall be  returning to Idaho until possibly August 19 for the Lewis and Clark  Highway dedication.  Almost six months of this session have passed, and we  probably have not handled more than about half of our legislative  calendar. The appropriation bills are bogged down and unless a  miracle happens, we will probably be in session until late in  September.  Under these logjam circumstances, it is beginning to  become doubtful whether we shall have an omnibus bill in this  session of Congress. It is still anticipated the House will con­sider  such a bill late in July or in August, but it seems that so  little progress 1s being made because of the opposition - especially  in the House - to the Kennedy program that anything can happen.

I~ANDI ........" ............ " •  .JOINT COMMITT1IJ[:  A .....IC~  -... .. v,...- U.•• ,.............._,.  The Honorable A. B. Curtis  Mayor, City of Orofino  Orofino, Idaho  Dear Bert:  Replying to your letter of June 7, I am happy that you are watch­ing  developments affecting Bruces Eddy. It does appear that everything is  progressing in an orderly manner, but the real test will come when a project  is included in the omnibus bills in both the House and Senate. I am sure  that the Senate will approve the project, but I have no way of forecasting  how the House will react. It is possible the Wildlife Federation may plan  opposition and lobby the House Public Works Committee against the project.  In reference to sending representatives to Washington to testify  for the project, I would think that when the House considers the Omnibus  bill, it would be appropriate. I have been advised that the bill will originate  in the House this year; and, if favorable action is taken there, I anticipate  no trouble in the Senate. Likewise, if the bill contains authorization of  Bruces Eddy, I should be able to get an appropriation to start construction  before the end of this session.  I certainly hope that no controversy will arise over details of the  authorization. As you will recall, Frank Church released some publicity  several weeks ago, indicating that some restrictions on distribution of power  and other facilities on the reservoir, will be sought. I also hope that you  and the local group are able to work with the Army Engineer Corps at Walla  Walla, Washington, to reach agreement on several aspects of the project.

I am particularly  eager to know about the inspection made at the Bruces Eddy site  and whether there was much oppeslt1on on the part of fish and wild­life  enthusiasts.  You probably have been reading about the defeat of the medi­care  plan in the Senate and the President' 5 announcement that he  will make this an issue in the November campaign. My correspon­dence  would indicate that there is overwhelming sentiment against  this medicare plan under the Social Security System.  I have been checking developments on the House side 1 particu­larly  regarding the Omnibus bill. I understand that Cliff Davis,  Congressman from Tennessee I who is Chairman of the Public Works  Subcommittee, is engaged in the primary campaign, which accounts  for some of the delay here.  Kindest regards.  Sincerely yours,  brs'hCaJkz,.,~I,Q"""'\:  United States Senator 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/142	142	143.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/143.pdfpage

I will have to admit that 'When I read the laat. paragraph of your letter  I practically pass(;d out with the thought that.

It Bruces  Ed&lt;Q' .tails in this session 1 know one to'Wl'l in Idaho that will. practlC&l..ly  fade away. The whole econanic situation in northern Idaho 1s about aa  bad as it could possibly be. I would suspect that about one third ot  our main street businesses will have closed signa on them in the next  year .it things don't pick up a bit. Bruces lddy will be a wondertul  shot in the arm tor the camnmity and it we can get the Canadian ll.ll1ber  stored on the stunp in Canada rather than being shipped to the United  States in canpetition, we could have a lot better place to liVE:. I sure  would appreciate- ;rour ettort to give the Bruces !'Ad;( cause a push and  see it we can't get something done. Ever,rone in town coll.ars me tdlcn I  get on the street and they all want to know what is happening.  We passed the hat &rO\lJ'1d tolCl this spring and raised a nice little BUIll  ot moncoy to send a tew people back, myself included, tdlen the Bruces  Eddy cause cemea up.

Curtis  Mayor of Orofino  Orofino, Idaho 83544  Dear Bert,  I am pleased and flattered that you would consider my views about  policy on public lands of the United States being retained or disposed  of.  1 find very little quarrel with Federal retention of blocked-out,  large ownerships for specific purposes, i.e., National Forests, parks  and recreation areas, military or other reservations, and reservoir  projects. Generally, in my opinion, these also should accommodate  collateral uses consistent with the primary purpose (for example,  grazing and recreation in a National Forest, grazing on reservoir  projects, etc.).  I can see no rationale for retention of scattered parcels of Federal  land outside the areas or projects mentioned in preceding paragraph ­for  instance, Weeks Law lands lying outside National Forests and any  scattered public domain parcels which were not retained or acquired  for specific purposes.  Having not had benefit of listening to testimony of the livestock  industry, I do not know its problems; but, personally, I find it hard  to believe that retention of public lands for their grazing privilege  should be a Federal responsibility.  As you mention, the Corps subscribes to the concept of multiple use.  The "deep freeze" concept has no place in our planning. I assume your  "deep freeze" expression has to do with locking up entire regions for 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/163	163	164.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/164.pdfpage

I have listened to the professional  foresters and sympathize with their impossible tasks of fire pro­tection,  disease and insect control, and forest management in  "wilderness areas".  I suppose my biggest frustration on public lands is the difficulty  in obtaining what we need from the Forest Service and BLM for our  reservoir projects. Our friends in both agencies are dedicated,  top-quality professionals, but they seem hamstrung by the numerous  rules, regulations, and laws under which they must operate.

Curtis  Mayor of Orofino  Orofino, Idaho 83544  Dear Bert,  This is a supplement to my letter of 21 January 1970 giving my views  on retention or disposal of public lands of the United States. In  that letter 1 commented on my problems in obtaining public lands for  our reservoir projects.  t thought it might be of interest to you to know something of the  Federal expense involved in exchanging 7,621 acres of State land in  the Dworshak Reservoir for BLM land. Under a 1964 formal agreement  among the Corps) BLM, and the State, the Corps must bear the adminis­trative  cost of BLM in making the exchange. To date, we have reimbursed  BLM $208,000 and the actual land exchange still is, at least, six months  from being completed. We expect another $25,000 to be billed to the  Corps by BLM before the exchange is consummated. This will amount to  over $30 per acre administrative cost to accomplish an exchange to  obtain the land we need for the reservoir.  This does not seem reasonable, yet the Corps is without discretion in  determining either the exchange procedure or the amount of administra­tive  cost.  On the pending 5,OOO-acre exchange to establish a big game management  area, BLM advises that it may cost the Corps $150,000 to $200,000 for  administrative expense. This would be $30 to $40 per acre. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/166	166	167.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/167.pdfpage

B. Curtis  Mayor of Orofino  Box 1238  Orofino. Idaho 83544  17 February 1971  Thank you for your letter of 28 January 1971 concerning our Lower  Clearwater River study.  The copies of the articles and speeches you sent describe very well  the dilemma we face in trying to meet the increasing demands for re­sources  and still conserve these same resources to preserve the quality  of the environment. Hopefully, we can reconcile some of these conflicting  demands Bud develop a plan of operation for the Dworshak project that will  not adversely affect the river environment.  The Lower Clearwater River study is a part of the Columbia River and  Tributaries review report. The overall study purpose is to consider  means of best satisfying future water resource needs in view of changed  conditions over the past 20 years. One of the principal future needs  will be, as you know, for electrical power, and particularly for peaking  power, as the system changes from primarily hydro to a system with a  thermal base and hydro peaking. The peaking capability of each plant in  the system varies, especially in the degree of its effect on downstream  river environment. The study will evaluate these variations, and any  recommendations will give careful consideration to environmental factors.  I think that the principal consideration at present is that these studies  be completed to provide a basis for rational decisions. I am more  concerned by the lack of support by responsible agencies and individuals  for the study's need than I am by the extent of opposition to any  development, as expressed at the public meeting and in statements 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/175	175	176.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/176.pdfpage

The reason for my concern is also well expressed  in the talk by John Carver that you sent, especially the portion you  bracketed on page 7.  In view of the general apprehension that the purpose of the study is  to justify a reregulating dam, I anticipate that we will have consider­able  difficulty obtaining meaningful public participation in the planning  process. I think it would be very helpful if some responsible local or  state group, that recognizes the importance of a careful analysis of all  aspects of our resources, were to assume leadership in the definition and  expression of truly representative public views. I would appreciate any  suggestions along this line that you may have.  I appreciated your kind remarks) and I hope that you can furnish me with  some ideas of how we can establish a meaningful participation by the  public and/or their representatives in the study process. Members of  my staff are always willing to meet with responsible groups or individuals  to discuss the study objectives and the study findings as they develop.  Sincerely yours,  RICHARD M.

UTAH  We Stand For the Constitution Of The United States  As Having Been Divinely Inspired  •  6A EDITORIAL PAGE SATURDAY, NOVEM!ER 7, 1970  u.s. Power Crisis:  How Far Can We Go?  Which is more important - protecting the environment  or producing enough electrical power to supply the nation',  burgeoning needs?  That is the question that must be answered. soon. As Dr.  Lee A. duBridge, the President's science adviser, puts it, th~  nation faces "a crisis in the taBk of generating enough elec­tricity  to meet our rising every-d&y demands."  That crisis was first dramatized just five. years ago  Monday when an electrical relay the me of & shoebox failed. in  a Canadian sub-station.  The failure. coming at a heavy peak time for power  plants all over the Northeast U.S. and eastern Canada, caused  a series of electrical failures that plunged nine states and two  Canadian provinces into darkness. It caused massive transpor­tation  tieups and economic losses before power was restored.  some 12 hours later.  The lessons of that blackout - the largest but by oef  means the only such failure - are still being assessed in  terms of the nation's need for more &nd more power.  What are those needs? According to Borne scientists, the  U.S. will need 543 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity in the  year 2000, three times the amount used today. Power neede  are expected to double by 1980 over that used in 1969.  Power authorities figure at least 340 new generating  plants are needed by 1990 to meet the power demands. Just to  supply land for new transmission lines by tha.t date will  require more than h\ice the area of Delaware.  But, say the environmentalists, generating and transmit·  ting more and more power means more air and water poIlu.  tiOD. And practically every type of genera.ting plant has come  under attack - fossil-fueled (coal and oil) plants because  they pollute the atmosphere and cause thermal pollution  (beating of water) ; nuclear plants because of thermal pollu­tion  and radiation hazards; and hydroelectric projects because  they mar the landscape of otherwise seenic rivers.  Of 65 nuclear plants scheduled for completion by 1976, 23  are behind schedule. Of 125 conventional power plants, 23 are  lagging behind. And in New England alone, 60 per cent of the  new power plants and transmission lines are behind schedule.  Nor do the alternatives to conventional electrical plants  offer much hope. Scientists, for instance, feel that some day  fuel cells like th'OSe that power the Apollo space craft may be  made economical enough for home and industrial use. A low·  hazard atomic "fusion" generator 'is under construction. And  researchers are seeking ways to squeeze non-polluting fuel out  ....I!

Frank McElwee has worked for Con Ed of New York since September 1969  when he left a partnership in Coverdale &Colpitts. He is in charge of  constructing a nuclear plant. His address is:  Resident Construction Manager  Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y., Inc.

I think Frank works for General Woodbury, another retired Corps man.  I am proud that Charles Luce would look to the Corps to get men to put  Con Ed back on the track. Despite those who call the Corps evil names  and despoilers of the environment, the top people both uniformed and  civilian are unequaled as engineers and managers.  I will acquaint Colonel Connell with your desire for dedication ceremonies  for the Dent and Grandad Bridges. In my opinion, you should be recognized  for conceiving them. Senator Jordan, Senator Church, and Representative  McClure will be officially involved - as will Governor Andrus.

You might suggest that the Corps provide  assistance to Whatever local groups are selected to sponsor the dedica­tions.

Box 634  lewiston, Idaho 8350 1  SPONSORS A FOURTH  NORTHWEST COMMEMORATIVE  "1973"  "DWORSHAK DAM"  On the North Fork of the Clearwater Riller near Orofino, Idaho, stands  Dworshak Dam. II is the hittle.! strai,ht·axis, concrete .ravity dam in  the Western Hemisphere and the laraesl ever constucted by the U.S. Army  Corps of Ena1neefs. Out of the 118 major dams IIsled in the world  Dworshak 1$ the 15th hiahest. Only two other dams in the United Stat.,  • e hilhef, HOG'Ilr and CkoYllIe.  The crest of the dm soars 711 'HI aIlove bedrock. Over sill million  cubic yards of conae!. _nt into construction of the tlJae strucb.l"e.  The crest of the dam runs 3,300 leet bank-to-tlank. At the base, it is  525 feet thick and tapers to 30 feet in width at the crest where a two­lane  road runs across the dam.  Dworshak's 4O·foot-divet'sion tunnel, drilled tlYouah the mountain on  the len abutment, was closed September 27, 1971, and the reservoir beaan  to !ill. The pool Is not expected to be completely filled llntil Jllly, 1974.  The reservoir will be 630 feet deep near the face of the dam. Storaae  capacity of the reservoir Is 3,450,000 acre-feet. Two million aae-leet  will be llSed for local Ind realonal llood control storap and for ofl.site  and downstream power pneration.  In the powerhouM there are U_ee hydroelectric pneratDrs capable  of producil'lll enouth- power to Il(ltlt a City the SIze of Boise, Idaho.  There is space In the powerhouse to add Ihree IMKI aenerators.  Conslrt.chon 01 ttll dati b10cMed ot! the anadromous sleelhead trout  rr,a'l on the North FalX. To perpetll3te the strain, the Corps of EnallleefS  built the Dworshak National Fish HltChery, just downstreaftll from tM dllll  al the confllJf!nte. It is tfle Tarp" stwlhead halchery in the world.  The lirst jllvenile steelhead, smolts, were released Irom the hatchery in  Apfl~ 1970. Adult spaw~rs, from the f.rst rillased, have retllrned to  the hatchery and a complete cycle has taken place. The hatchery releases  3,000,000 steelhead smalts Ivery sprina aOd has reared 2.5 million rainbow  and kokanee annllally for the reSIdent lishery-In the reservoir.  The reservoir IS 53 miles lona and extends into the wild, rllned  timber land. Five thousand acres are presently beina J1liIn.aaed for elk  browse and "abitat in the upper reaches 01 the reservoir and 10,300  acres of land have been set aside fOt recrealtonal uses. The Nez Perce  Indians will operate the Bli Eddy recreatlon.al area under a 25-year  lease .........nt with the CGrps 01 Enline.-s.

Curt1s  IIo;yor of the City of Orofino  C'rofino, Idsho  Dear I!oo'or Curtis:  Reference is made to your letter of 22 Mercb 1954 requesting illi"OlWt­tion  pertinent to queationo that have been reiBed about the plsno of the  Corps of Engineers for relocating the Levis and Clark Highv~ through the  proposed Penny Cliffs Reservoir area.  ;rhe purpose of • survey report by the Corps of Engineero, such S8 that  recently su1:lDitted on the Iliddle'Snake Hiver, is to detsnains and _ent  information concerning the feasibility end eCODOlllic justification for a  potentiel project, eo that Congrees in further consideration of the project  will have beses on wbich to determine whether it should be authorised for  construction. Investigations end detem1nations of a .cope be;yood those  required to _pUsh this purpose are usjustified at this stage of develop­ment  of a project. Investigationo end detsnainations in connootion with the  Poney Cliffs projeot have been brought to, but not be;yood, this scope.  Answers to spesific questions reiBed in your latter are .. follows:  1. It is DOt entiaipated that the total curvature of the re­locsted  portion of the Levis end Clark HiglJw~ would be materially greater  or less then that of the portion of the higI:II~ which would be reodered  unusebls by the reservoir.  2. It is not enticipated that the length of the Levis and Clark  HiglJw~ through the proposed Penny Cliffs Rssel"l?ir ares would be materiel­l;  y increased or decreased as a result of routing the higlJw~ above and  around the proposed reservoir. It is certein that the changed length, if  BDY. would be of UD1mportent magnitude. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/226	226	227.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/227.pdfpage

Honorable A. Bo Curtis 12 April 1954  4. Our plena for relocation of the Lewis end Clerk RighwSO'  provide that it would ascend from the river level in the vic1nit;r of  Kooskia to required elevation above pool level in the vicinity o£ the  Penn;r Cliffs Dam. Along the pool, ths profile of the highwSO' would be  approx1Jllate1;r pnrnlle1 to that of the reservoir IlDd of the LaobBa River  .. arfected b;r the backweter effect of the dam. At DO tae in· our p1onn1ng  have we conoidered placing the highw'8¥ an excesoive diatence above the  reservoir pool, along dre1nsgee other then those now followed b;r it, along  hieh ridges, or over s1.mlIDits other than that of the Lola Pass.

TUDm, 1lIJlER SEC;iETA.'lY ""'""Ol', TO 'l'IlE lM'ICIJ'  FOWl!, liEW YmK CITY, IlAIleH 4, 1954  One ot t.he most debated domestic issues in this co\m:try 1:.odq 18 the  catter of ownership of electric po'ller generating and tronsm1ssion fac1llties  -shaU the own.r.hip b. by privete lovc.tore, local public bodies of th.  Federal Government. At the end of 1953, the ownership of IX&gt;ver facilities  b.tw.en the•• thr.e perti•• was dividod with .pproximately 78f, own.d by private  investors, l~ by non-Federal public bodies and 12% by the Federal Government.  J'articipetion by the F.deral Ocvarnment 10 thi. field can be trae.d back  to 1906 when the llational Reclamation Act was emended to parmit th. Federal  Ocvernmant to loalOO. the generation of power 10 its roclamation projects.  That law and all of th. Reclamation laws .1ooe that t1J:l. have followed th.  pr1n :ple that th. prlmar;y interest of the OcverlElent was reclamation of land  end the generation of .lectric energy was a byprod.ct. Later, legislation  for flood control and navigation improvement permitted the Federal Ocvemment  to include power generation 88 a byproduct of those add!ticmal pr1mary ~P08es.  The Tennessee Valley Authority 18 an exception to theee remarks 88 it has  outgrow the baalc conoept of generating power 88 a byprtduot of nood control  and naVigation. It hall undertaken to supply the enUre power needs of an area.  It 18 not part of the Deportment of the Interior, and therefore, my remarks do  not apply to it.  Because of the importance of this Bubject and because there \lere 80 DI.8D¥  uncerts1nti•• regarding past and future policies, the D.pertcent of th. Inter­ior,  with the concurrence of the President and his Cabinet, ",suod A ppygr  oolicy .tatllment on Augunt lB of IM~ year. It was brief and cl.ar and 10 general  it was fevorably rec.ived throughout the country. I believ., thaugb, that it  would be wall 1£ I called your attention again to the most important part of this  .tetement. It rendo as follow.:  "Th. prlmar;y r ••""".ihilities of the D.perttlent are the reclsmation of arid  and semiarid lands under tho Federal Reclamation Lows and. the developnent of  natural resources os authorized by Concress. These responsibilities include the  dispoaal of surplus elect.':"fu anergy which can be economically produced in the  course of the develot=ment of these resources. The Department of the Interior  'Will, therefore, actively plan end reocmnend cODstnlCtion of generat.1Dg f'ac1l1­ties  10 hydro proj.cts und.r ite juri.diction when .uch facilities are .conomically  justified and feasible.

The responsibility of the Department  of the Interior is to give leadership and assistance in the conservation end Wlse  utilization of natural reaourCGSo The Department does not assume that 1t has  exolusive right or responsibillty for the construction of dams or the generation"  transmission and sale of electric energy in any area, basin, or region. In  general, it will not oppose the construction of facilities \lhich local interests,  either public or privato, are willing and able to provide in accordance with  licenses and other controls of the Federal Power Commission or other appropriate  regulatory bodios and \lblch are consonant vith the best developnent of the natural  resources of the area. n  This stateoent answers a great many questions, but like everytb.iDg else, it  deserves some SIil.plificatlon in connection vith specific matters.

However, I am. quite familiar  'With the pollcloa of the Administration in this matter, and I kno'W of no state­ment  by ony reSfOr..alble t:le~ber of the Administration 'Which is contrary to 'What  1 have Just .aid.  Thera are several good reasons fo our positiOD and there are two in  particular which I am sure you, as financial men, will f'ul.ly appreciate. In  the fL~t place J we ere Ii1Uch more nnx10us to have any available cred1t used  for the financing of nev fncillties rather than s1IJply transferr1..ng debt fra::l  one party to enothar. Tl.s InttAr docs not create any new kilovstte or bring  servlc3 to any ~dd!t1onal people.  Another rassen for our position ie that it \lould be generally impractical  to consid.er the sale of l"ederal facilities. As an example, let me consider a  truly academic case. Let us assume that the matter of selling the Hoover Dam  \lith its gerer ting facilities to bs under consideration. To begin With, there  is no "For &de" sign on Heover Dam. liar/over, if there \le~, it 'Would certainly  be necessery to rc~ch an agreement sma."lg the States of California, NeVada, and  Arizona, bet"een wr,ich the benefits from this pro.1ect are divided. In fact, I  think the only possible purch85er for this proJ ect would be some &uthority or  bony C1:"e.t.ted by these three states acting in unison. In view at the great di­vergenca  of opinions regarding the division ot waters ot the Colorado River,  there would seem to be no possibility, even remote, of having thes~ three states  jo~n in such an effort. Then, even it they did and it they made a propoaal to  the Fedoral Governt:lcnt 'Which would rn.ake full reimbursement, that proposal would  have to be approved by the Congress and the President. There is no authority  in the law for selUng those projects withou.t such special legislation.  These are only two of the m03t apparent difficulties involVed but I think  they are sufficient to illustrate to you that, aside fran the basic principles  to be raced, it would be rather impractical to consummate such a sale.  There ~ be 8~S isolated exceptions to the above rule and it i8 possible  that the Central VUl.07 Project in California is on. of th.... This project 1.  1Ohol1¥ within CaUforni&. The State orlg1na1l.y planned to build th. demo, power­houses,  eanal.G, etc., fran its O'lm resO'.lrCes. However, the depresaion brought  about a condition that e.&de this difficult and the Federal Government was en­couraged  to initiate the work. California has always had sane idea ot acquir­ing  the facilities that have been built. The State r&cent1y approached the  Federal Government on this matter and we have, in effect. told them that we  will con ider it if the Federal Government recoverB 8S many dollars from the  purchase as it would if it retained ownership of the project. It we reach  agreement aa to price and conditions, it will then, of course, be necessar:r for  California to obtain Federal. legislation to authorize the ~chase and sale.  In a simjlar vein, the State of Arizona has approached us with the thought  in mind that tha State Po-.rer Authority might purchase the 1'eeder tranami.ssion  lines wolly 1dthin that State. These transmission lines L'""e exclusive 01' those  that intol"Connect Hoover Dac., Davis Dam and Parker Dam.

In the fi­nal  analysis, it will be necessary for the State of Arizona to seek the neeee­SaJ7  Federal legis1.2.tion.  Again, ~ I emphasize that the Department ot Interior ie not tl")'ing to  sell theoe properties and if a eale 1s CCl%13'UlXD&ted in either or both tnatancea,  it lrill be en exception to a general rule.  As tor new projects, wa do not propose to recQilIllend the canstNetion ot new  generating or transmission facilltiee which can be provided by either p.1bl1c or  private local interoste. There are, nowever, sane projects which can onl.T be  undertaken by the Federal Government and, in those instances, we will 80 re­commend.  An exemple of this is the Upper Colorado River Basin development which  our Department recent1.7 recCXllltended to the Congress. In this cue there are  same very large multipurpose dams with reservoirs located in two or more States  and with other complications which would make it well nigh impossible tor erJ;T  local interest to successful..ly undertake the work.  We do have a VElI7 strong desire to create a healt~ atmosphere so that lo­cal  inter.sts L'ld risk capital TIlI17 have a bettor 0_rtunit7 to participate In  these power developncnts. The increased de=.and for electric power in this  countr7 is so groat that it &gt;dll require the cooparati.... ettorte ot all ot the  interested parties to meet the n600s. For the paet several ;yeare approxlm&tely  three billion dollars ot risk capital. a year have gone into the electric genera­ting,  transmission D,nd distribution facilitios of the country. It is fortunate  that this has not beem a part of our increasing Federal debt. It is expected  that dUring the next two years, the investments will be even greater and there­after  we can only estimate but there 1s little doubt that demands tor new faci­litics  will be hcaV7 lndeed. The job is 60 big that lnveator capital II1U8t be  encourClBed a.nd we propose to do just that.  ~!e havo otten asaerted that \Ire are in favor of a partnership between the  Federal Government and local interests in this matter of power developll8J1t.  Sate people have felt such an arrangement r:ay it'Nolve a contractual document  ot SCBe torm. Such will not genera.l.l7 be the case and, to the extent that the  term "partnership,tl has this implication, it 1s unfortunate. We do mean that  thc Federal Government ohould undertake 0nI7 those projecte which cannot be pr0­vided  by local, public or frCG enterprise and that we will encourage in f!ftIery  way possible locn! interests in undertakings which they can hancUe.  Thore mll also be a number of projects In which we can actual.l7 join in  a proper common etfort. A number of bills have alread,y been introduced into  the Congress and more can bc expected, all having to do with individual ~  electric plants. The best of these anticipates that the local interests will  provide all of the u:.one;y rn:edcd to financ3 the costs allocated to power ldlile  the Federal Gov"ernment provides the mone;y for irrigation, flood control and  navigation. The capital costs of 8D7 Federal investment in irrigation will be  returned by the local interests from collections from irrigators or power sales.  An excellent illustration of such a project is that one proposed. bl' two  irrigation districts in the San Joaquin Valley ot California. This is mown  as the Tri-Dam Project and is spontlorcd by the Oakdale and South San Joaquin  Irrigation DistTicts. It is estimated to cost approximate1¥ 55 million dol.l.are  and tho districts propose to provide the funds for the power facilities which  &gt;doll cost approxllnate17 44 million dollar. from the eale of revenue bonda.  Their Congressman haG introduced lcgii.ation which will authorize the Federal  Government to participate In thie project b7 contributing appraximatal7  $1,000,000 to p&7 tor flood control benefit. and edvancing, lntereet-tree,  4 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/235	235	236.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/236.pdfpage

I have often fondcred if )"01.1 can loan money for the f'urther developnent of  this basic dcvelopnont with tt.:lturiticB a9 mlch as 50 Teare. This 8C1:Dewbat longer  perind than is normalJ,y customary would bs in keepl.I18 with the pa;yout poriod  adopted tor Federal projects and ~lOuld maka local financing more attractive.  Perhaps you ma;y think of othsr features of financing in this field which  "ould be helpful. I urge you to consider them and porticulsrly 10 the light of  the very stability ot this kind of an invo3tment.  This Administration has a fundamental faith in tree enterprise. We be­lieve  it has to a. very large extent been responsible for the great grtJJfth of  this l:etion. At tha same tke we are \roll aware, as I am. sure you are, that  there have been sane excesses fran tiIi:.e to time. While these excesses are in DO  w;q to be co~oncd, they have ccrtainJ..y not been such as to juetif'y a:rry changes  i.'l our basic philosop.V. You have a large responsibility 10 this philosoplJ;y.  but I believe you can subscribe wi-th ue to the incentives that inspired creative  imagi.nation in our econo:!1Y. We havs faith in local initiative and urge the ac­ceptance  of increased local responsibility, except in cases lChere the resources  of the Federal Government alone can insura econcad.caJ. and. etfective action.  You in your perticll.ler field can do a great deal to assist in increasing this  loca~ responsibility.  xxxx  6 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/237	237	238.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/238.pdfpage

Page 1									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														QUICK RE.."EREIlCE NOTF.S  BROOFS EDDY PROJECT  Twenty-tive years agoD in 19.35:1 the tour Northwest states--Washington, Oregon,  Ilontana and Idahc--had on.1J 1,800,000 10&lt; of installed capacity; in 1955 they had  7 million lew of installed capacity--a. 300 percent increase. Now - about 400  percent 1n~reaseo  In the 20 yeaT&lt;--1930 to 1950--population jumped !rom 3.5 million to 5.1 million,  a 45 percent gain.  In 195!" we had ahou 7 million kw ot capacity in the Northwest, of which about  95 peree.t;t was hydro. Sane 3; ron] ion kilowatts are owned and marketed by the  Federal Govermnent and the remainder by private and publicly-owned utilities.  The consumption ot electricity in the four Northwest states multiplied eight  times between 1935 and 1954--from 4 billion kwh to 32 billion kwh--comparod with  a fivefold 1n~rea6e in the United States as a whole. So fast is the consumption  of electricity growing in the region that loads are expected to triple in the  next 13 years--by 1974. The region will then be consuming 90 billion kwh, not  allowing tor any new electroprocess industries.  In the firet 10 years following the end of World War II, we added 3.5 million  kw in the region, but the danand has consistently outgrown the supply. At times  there has been an actual. shortage of power to meet the loads. When waterflow in  the rivers dropped to low levels, as in the winter of 1952-1953, we have had to  curtail. the use of electricity by industry. Another result of the power pinch  has been to hamper the expansion of electroprocess plants and to discourage new  industries !rom locating in the region.  In the 1.!lst 5 years, nearly .3 million lew have come on the line from plants under  construction--the equivalent of one Bonneville dam annuall.y. Yet we face a  serious power shortage in the Northwest unless new dams are started soon. By  the early 60'1s loads" which are rising at a rate or 7 percent annua.lly compounded,  will exceed the availability of power from all the generating plants, existing  and under construction.  We estimate that the Northwest will need at least 9 million additional lew over  the naxt 20 year&--or one Bonneville dam a year--to meet the growing power loads  of residential, ccmnercial and small. industrial cons\l1lers. It we are to have an  expa-,sion ot electroproces5 industries, we will need over 12 million kw'--almost  twice &8 much as is now installed in the region.  The people ot the Northwest are well aware of this situation and are making plans  to meet it. FortunatelJr, we have ample water resources awaiting developnent. In  fact~ scarcely one-fourth of the energy that resides in the Columbia River and  its tributaries has been tapped so far, although nearly all the lower cost sites  have been, or are, under developnent. . 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/245	245	246.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/246.pdfpage

I wanted to  with those Hells Canyon hearings.  our two Clearwater dams now, Bert.  tell you that you did a good job  I want to ask you what you think  lIow do they look?  there  about  Mr. Curtis: They look awfully good, Len.  Mr. Jordan: I mean as far as opposition, wildlife opposition. etc.  Mr. Curtis: It is pretty well quieted down, Len.  out the country here that the wildlife people have  they don't have a leg to stand on.  It is recognized through­oversold  their ease and  Mr. Jordan: ~mong my other chores here. I am planner here around with tbis  development thing. Bert I think that we will try and get those two Clear­water  dams split away from the Middle Snake - Pleasant Valley, Mountain  Sheep. You know those all came out in one report. The Bureau of Reclama­tion  would like to hang m to the Army and send them all lip together. But  we have been trying to get them split off because they are entirely different.  Those Clearwater dams are for storage. flood control and these other running  rivers. I think I·ve got those private utilities very much interested in  the Middle Snake. They are also interested in the Clearwater Dam if we  can get them on a partnership basis. But the non-reimbursables are a good  deal higher on the Clearwater and I think what we will have to do is to  get them authorized because anything that the federal Government goes into  on any kind of a percentage basis has to be authorized. I think that if  \~ could get the Department of Interior to hold the bill we will try and  get those Clearwater Dams, a bill set up to authorize. Then we l'fill try  and work out a partnership program with them so that some local sponsor.  maybe that group of utilities. will take care of the part allocated for  power and let the government stand the budget control basis of it. How  does that sound?  Bert: That sounds wonderful, Len.  that could corne along a year or so  In other words it would  afterwards, couldn't it?  be a partnership  k. Jordan: Yes. some time afterwards. There is no harm done in getting  these dam authorized, if there is going to be a battle about them we might  just as well get that oVer with and we can talk partnership later on. See  what I mean? 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/250	250	251.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/251.pdfpage

Mr. Jordan: Because, Bert, if there is some different money in any part  of it we have to go through the authorization proceedure.  ~k. Curtis: Well, Len, the utilities would pay for the cost of falling  water at a fixed price arranged by agreement at a later date, wouldn't  they?  Mr. Jordan: Yes, that is to be worked up. They have got one partnership  deal they are trying to work up down on the Trinity project in California  where the utilities pay for the falling water. We probably, and this is  confidential, we will probably have a bill going in here on John Day down  where the utilities actually put up about 88% of the cost. They just get  a 50 year contract for all the power plant produces. You see they don't  own the plant in anytime. So there is lots of ways to work, depending on  what percent is determined to be allocated in for power and what percent  is non-reimbursed. But in any case I want you to know what we are working  at here, so you wouldn't be caught flat-footed and you have done such a  whale of a good job on this thing, I just wanted to be sure that that  would be alright with your thinking.  Mr. Curtis: It certainly would be, Len, It is just fine. I've talked to  Kinsey about this quite a bit and he is very hopeful that we can get some­bing  going. And, of course, I talked to Henry a little bit out here last  week and he doesn't know what is going to happen but he sure hopes that  something can get underway.  ~lr. Jordan: Well, I talked to him or gave my influence and he wanted to  just turn one of them. Nell my thinking is that the one of them will draw  just as much fire as the two of them will together.  Mr. Curtis: Well, I think so, of course, we will have a lot more resistance  on Penny Cliffs, that's recognized but we will have to start both to get one.  I think that is the right stragedy ell the way through. Well I am sure  awfully glad that you hadn't forgotten us, I knew you hadn't.  Mr. Jordan: Well, the white house putre on this special job, I mean to  get the projectgoing out there. Now that's confidential. But I knew how  your interest was and I'm working at it all my spare time.  Mr. Curtis:  the leg work  \qell thank  for us.  heavens we have somebody back there that will do  Mr. Jordan: Well I did want to talk  to eye because we always have been.  when we get to going on it.  to you and see if this thing was eye  I sure will have to have your help  Mr. Curtis: Len, you can rest assured that everybody in North Idaho is  right down the line on this.

MEETING  Dallas, Cregon  April Ie, 1955  \  The meeting was opened with reading of minutes and a resolution offered  for the passing of Wayne Talbot, Nezperce County representative to I.E.W.A.  A report of James Davis, Director of Organization, w3s~11 received. He  stated that $6,500 was credited to his effort in the last six months. lie  has done a lot of work in Mlitman County and plans to contact the First  National Bank and r. S. 'alional Rank of Portland,Oregon soon. These two  banking organizations have been very helpful. A motion was made and passed  to retain his services.  Herb :lest, Executive Vice President of the Organization, stated th&lt;lt the  Washington outlook was a very confused picture, particularly~e appropria­tions  picture, and that hearings have been delayed socewhat from the usual  time. He plans to go back to hearings as soon as he is advised by members  of Congress.  A six year program was discussed, a detail of which is in the file. It was  mentioned that Ice Barbor originally planned for 195,(00 k.w. will go up  with good water to 320,000 or possibly as much as 400,000 k.w. It also  will be possible to have navigation somewhat limited, but possibly as much  as 12 months of the year.  Grant County P,L.D. have a temporary permit on Priest Rapids on partnership  plan. The issues here are pretty much embroiled and at the moment little  can be reported.  Channel improvement of the lo_~r Columbia River bar was discussed by John  J. Winn, ~anger of the Port of Portland. He said there was little hope for  channel work this year, but it was imperative that channel be kept at maximum  dept. Perhaps this should be drawn to the attention of Congress so that  action can be taken in another year.  Colonel James Moorhead, Portland District Engineer reported on Dallas Dam.  He stated that they are going to save some money on the original $300,000 OOD  estimate. He does not know hO\~ much will be saved, but thinks that it might  be considerable. The first generator will go on the line in f\ovember, 1957.  Some of the reasons money is being saved is because of the key competition  by contractors. He mentioned that $11,000,000 have been saved on generators  over the original estimate. All the generators, so far. it appears will be  American made which companies have been out bidding foreigh business which  has to this date been shut out. He says this looks very good. Another  reason for the saving is the improver:lents of construction, experience gained  in other projects and several real good bids which went to Morris and  Knutson Company for relocations Qfrlhighway and railway facilities on both  sides of the pool which company/t!b"siderably below the estimate. He said  he thought some of the contracting companies were hungry for business.  There are 17 miles of S.P. and S. relocation work to be done on the Wash­ington  side. In one instance $3,OOO.~ was saved by a Morris and Knutson  contract. He reported that navigation would close on the Dallas Dam site  for 3 months, perhaps September to November in 1956, at the time they will 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/254	254	255.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/255.pdfpage

The publicity will be given to it and transpcr la­tion  facilities will be aided in any way possible, but there was not much  they could do other than to close the channel during this 90 day period  in 1956.  Considerable discussion came up over the hazard of the interstate bridge  across the Columbia between Portland and Vancouver. lie said that Trumm  Hobbs money may be obtained later but not now. Before Truman I-Iabhs money  can be used a real menace to transportation must be shown of a more serious  nature. The new bridge is being planned higher. At the present time, the  thinking is that the interstate bridge may be a hazard to navigation. al­though  not proved to be so at this time.  A. B. Curtis discussed the Clearwater and lower Snake River Dams and stated  that the Pacific Northwest Power Company was studying these four projects  with excellent progress being made. lIe reported that the only opposition  to Bruces Eddy or Penny Cliffs was from the wildlife interests which organiza­tions  have done a good job of overselling their case and now have very little  following, he believed.  ~orman l. Krey, Vice President for Woshington J.E.W.A. and Northwest Manager  of Kieser-Aluminum spoke on the Columbia River corporation bill. He stated  that the bill noW was in its forth draft. It was first hoped to have it  ready for this session of Cpngress, but due to the Hells Canyon jangle, there  is no opportlmity for t-h~xt Congress. They are having quite a few objec­tionable  features worked on and much yet remains to be dore before the bill  will be in it's final form. It will need the unified support of the area for  favorable action. The bill is strong priority for the public agencies and  the people will not go for it. The bill has good .leatures but many wrinkles  to be worked out. The principal is to take over the B.P.A,form a new Columbia  Valley Corporation, taking the revenue from federal dams and issue revenue  bonds to build new projects. Section 2-A of the bill plans to include ~lontana  heretofor not considered. 3-A will state that each of the four states will  have a man on the board. which includes Nashington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana  and the fifth member of the board to be appointed by the president making a  five man board. Section 7-8 calls for the corporation to sell power only to  the consumer with permit by local consumer. Section Ii states that the Lnited  States and that the four states get together on a compact so as to borrow  money about as easy as the federal government, The (. S. would hold second  mortgage. The corporation would be non-profi t. exempt by taxation and would  bring much industry to the Northwest.  He stated that the 308 report was full of holes and was a complete hydro  system with steam and atomic energy not considered. Some discussion come  up on the life of the many large dams in the Columbia River Basin. Colonel  Tandy was quoted in the use of about 150 years. It was mentioned that at  Grand Coulee where Ie generators are in operation, there is one of the 10  out of commission all the time. In other words, actually, there are but  17 generators at Grand Coulee rather than lb.  After much discussion and rehash of the development some discussion on  Bruces Eddy and strong edorsements from outspoken public and private power  leaders, including Mr. Charles Baker, who is a strong public power person,  all support possible was given to the Clearwater develorment. It was felt 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/255	255	256.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/256.pdfpage

Several  mentioned that they knew Magnuson and Jackson very well and thought good  support could come from them for the Clearwater. Several grain growers  organizations in the lower Columbia were very interested and asked ques­tions  about navigation Lenefits. This sold them on the Bruces Eddy  project and a very optimistic 'eeling was evident.  The meeting closed at about 5:30 with the ina] business being naming  Spokane for the next meeting of the directors on July 18. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/256	256	257.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/257.pdfpage

I. the 20 yearo--193O to 1950--popul.tlon ju~ed fr.. 3.5 million to 5.1  .11lion, a 45 percent gaia.

At  ti..s. there bas been aD actual sbortage of power to .eet the loads. When  waterflow in tbe ri.ers dropped to low leYels. as in tbe winter of Iq5~53.  we have had to curtail the use of electricity by industry. Another result  of the power pinch bas been to baaper the expansion of electroprocess plants  and to discourage new industries fra- locatIng in the region.  In tbe next 5 years, nearly 3 8illion k. will come on the line from plants  under construction--the equivalent oC ODe Bonneville da. annually.

Mr. Curtis~ He has endorsed it, has he?  Mr. Jordan: Yes and I delivered also a letter from the Bureau of the Budget,  the Administration's approval of it, I delivered a bill that has been looked  over by the Budget Bureau and they say it is o.k.  Mr. Cur tis: The Budget Bureau has o.k.ed it?  Mr. Jordan: Now that is all I can do. He said he would look it over. He  didn't say he would, he didn't say he wouldn't. The thing is already there  and if he won't do it I can get somebody to, because it is a good deal.  Mr. Curtis: Well what is your honest opinion, do you think he will do it?  Mr. Jordan:  you fellows  I don't know, he has been looking more favorably on it, since  have been writing to him up there.  Mr. Curtisl Sure, we have been squeezing the dickens out of him.  Mr. Jordan: Well, he has all he needs now, he can have that bill typed  up and in the hopper tomorrow if he wants to.  Mr. Curtis: John Corlett gave him a good plug a few days ago and, of course,  everybody around here have been going after him, Len. Is penny Cliffs  going to be tied into it in any way?  Mr. Jordan: No this is strictly just for the one, because 9S somebody  mentioned, 1 think the Army letter - one of the letters mentioned the pos­sibility  of wildlife objection we better wait a while to put that one in.  r just thought I would tell you, now I have gone with this thing as far  as I can. I'm not going to give him too much time, because I will have to  get somebody else.  Mr. Curtis: I had a letter from Henry about two days ago and he was extremely  optomistic and he indicated that within the next two or three days he expected  to do something with it, so I believe he will go ahead tomorrow, then.  Mr. Jordan: Well I don't know Bert, he has everything he needs, even the  draft of the bill. It toot a lot of time to please everybody, of course  it has to please the principals out here on the coast, out there and it  has to please the administration, Bureau of the Budget and the Corp of  Engineers. The first letter we got from the "Corp of Engineers I will tell  you privately wasn't good to have, I wrote back and told them to give us  another letter. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/271	271	272.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/272.pdfpage

Mr. Jordan:  that part of  It is drawn on the principles that the local  the cost of the dam allocated to power.  sponsor will pay  Mr. Curtis: That is 70%.  Mr. Jordan:  plant. Now  Government.  In addition  the dall will  to that  remin,  he will put in  the t1tle will  the total cost  be that of the  of the power  Federal  Mr. Curtis: Forever.  Mr. Jordan: Sure - he will only own the power generating equipment.  Mr. Curtis: Well that 5 substantial and that will give us pretty fair tax  base.  Mr. Jordan: That is the basis of it and the operating expenses will be  prorated as between the power and the power of the other benefit. It is  a very reasonable bill and nobody can object to it, I don't see how they  could, if he will really get in and work on it, I don't see how anyone  can turn it down.  Mr. Curtis: I don't see how he can. Well, Len, do you suggest a little  backing from here or should we give Henry a little more rope and let him go.  Mr. Jordan: Well letts give htm a day or two to read that bill over and  then I'll just have to tell hi. that if he won't put it in, I will get  somebody that will, because I can get soaebody.  Mr. Curtis: Well we're going to get ourselves on record.  Mr. Jordan: Well, I'm that far along with it, I just got that thing in shape  yesterday and I took it over to him today - that is one big step behind me.  Mr. Curtis: That is wonderful news.  Mr. Jordan: It took a little doing to get these letters of endorsement  not only of the plan but of the bill itself.  Mr. Cur tis: I am awfully glad that General Stephens came through. He  is a good soldier. Thanks a million, Len. We'll get busy in a couple or  three days if nothing happens.  Mr. Jordan: I don't want any publicity on this - I don't need any publicity  for myself.  Mr. Curtis: Well you will get that letter out - you'll get plenty of boost  on that.  Mr. Curtis: Alright Len, swell - Goodbye. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/272	272	273.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/273.pdfpage

Page 1									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														)  lEMORANIJUM  Conversation between A. B. Curti s and Henry Dworshak  June 23, 1955  Dworshak: I suppose it will pass in the Senate because the Senators over  here want it. It simply authorizes the Trinity Dam and this is the Bureau  of Reclamation instead of the Army Engineers which would be about the same  thing and provides money for survey and engineering work, and a year flDm  now when the Engineers make their report - then it will be determined  whether it will be built on the partnership plan or not. I called the  Whitehouse yesterday morning, I called Jordan this morning and 1 said now  I have been telling you fellows let the Engineers go ahead instead of hold­ing  up the wbole procession and then a year from now determine how you want  the power facilities built. That is what they are doing on this Trinity.  Now, I said all you have to do is to apply the same yard stick to Bruce's  Eddy as they used at Trinity, you're not doing that. I understand that  they have got their heads together and this morning I was told they had a  conference this morning to try to work out some compromise on Bruce's Eddy.  Now I don't know what it will be or who is handling it or anything else, but  I'm not the one that is holding up the procession. The Administration,  Jordan and these people are the ones that are doing it. I don't know when  you are going to get a dam if ever. I wanted to move in and get you a dam.  They apparently don't want one. Now maybe after the election next year if  the republicans win control of Congress why then maybe there will be a  change in that situation but if they have more democrats in the Senate than  1he house has in the next years election they won't buiid a straight Federal  dam.  Mr. Curtis: Maybe forty years more according to that.  Dworshak: Oh they will build you one, but it will be a straight federal  dam.  Mr. Curtis: Well a Federal dam wouldn't do us any good here.  Dworshak: Well I didn't say that it would.  that. The democrats if they are in control  ahead and build it.  I am not one of those who says  of Congress will vote to go  Mr. Curtis: The philosphy of a partnership dam is to get more local taxes.  Dworshak: I am for you on that - I think it is good. When they get John  Day bill through, you know they got one on that- was introduced months and  months ago - and when they get that through then we are going to mo~e right  in on them and use the same plan on Bruce's Eddy.  Mr. Curtis: Do you think that is the best, most feasible way to work it?  DM)rshak:  ship plan  No I don't,  we ,,"on't get  but if they don't  it through your's  get through  either.  John Day on the partner-  Mr. Curtis: You don't think ours will stand any better chance than John  Day?  Dworshak: Not as good, the army engineers say that the Bruce's Eddy is a  flood control dam while this John Day there is not any flood control. It 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/274	274	275.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/275.pdfpage
Page 2									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														/  ( ) r 1  is just a straight power dam end it lends itself to the partnership plan  very well. General Sturges said that because Bruce's Eddy is a flood mn­trot  dam basically it doesn't lend itself to a partnership plan. If you  can't get through John Day which is ideal how can you get through Bruce's  Eddy which is not ideal. It is just as simple as that. Somebody is care­less  with the truth out there, I don't know who is feeding you this bolony.  You tell them to send some of that bolony back here and after I eat enough  of it I can fall in line. These democrats are running the show. Now we  were lucky on Hells Canyon this morning, we had the vote, we won over long  on the committee to vote against the high dam. When they found out they  couldn't hold him in line after we debated for more than two hours Senator  Anderson acting chairman everybody was there except the Chairman Murrey  from Montana who is overseas - Geneva and won't be back until July 1st -­when  they saw they couldn't report out the high hells canyon dam why they  didn't take a vote so Hells Canyon failed to get action. They haven't  killed it, it just is that they didn't get a roll call-couldn't take action.  It just means as Chairman Anderson told me about an hour ago, they probably  wouldn't take action on it this session. Now I think. that you people are  facing a dead line. If we get out August 1st and they say Johnson the  democratic leader is dang a magnificient job, - We're going to get out ­that  is five weeks - so that you and I know they can't - if the bill was  introduced tomorrow you couldn't get the committee to act. You say about  getting the bill through. The bill immediately would go to the public works  committee in the senate of which the chairman is against partnership. He  is all out for public power and he is chairman - immediately he puts tre  bill in the pigeon hole. That is the end of it - nothing is done. You've  got to get action while the democrats are running this thing at least we  have to try to work out something that they want. 1 don't mean Federal, but  I'll get you some dope on this trinity dam and I think I will hear probably  tomorrow from th. Whitehouse and see what their plan is. Now I may call  you up and tell you if there is any thing new. Somebody has been kidding  somebody out there, Bert. I've been trying to get the Whitehouse to get  some kind of a deal just like Trinity. On Trinity they are getting the  authorization, getting money for the engineering and a year from now or  18 months, from now the engineers will bring in their report and before  money is made available to start construction, there will be an agreement  reached as to the generating facilities of the project - who ~ll do what.  Then Congress would make the determination but in the mean time Trinity  is being authorized and getting money for engineering work and it is not  standing still. That is what I want to do up at Bruce's Eddy and then give  you fellows 12 or 18 months to work out a partnership plan.  Mr. Curtis: Well that would be wonderful.  Dworshak: But the Administration will not go along on it, unless they held  this meeting today. I told them that I only want the same treatment for  Bruce's Eddy that they are giving Trinity. I said I don't want discrimination.  But don't get excited about what is going to happen because of the chairman  of the public works committee in the senate. He does care because he is  goingto do what the democratic party here wants. You don't know how cold  blooded we are here - we live in a fridgid zone here.  Mr. Curtis: Well, Henry, our spirits have been built up pretty high here.  Jordan called me last week and said that everything looked mighty fine. He  said he had a bill pretty well praff-read, had laid it on your desk, had  General Steven's approval of it and that the Director of the Bureau of the  Budget had o.k.ed and the bill had been pretty well drawn. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/275	275	276.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/276.pdfpage

Mr. Curtis: Of course, we feel that we should take every opportunity and  try our best to get it through, especially if we can.  ~rorshak: Well it is just as I told the Administration, but they don't  seem to appreciate that.  Mr. Curtis: Well something has got to happen to stir them up I guess.  DWOTshak: We should run Jordan for the senate so he can get that stuff  through.  Mr. Curtis: Well he may have a chance if Herman don't come along,  Dworshak: Isn't Berman going to do well.  Mr. Curtis: Well it don't look too good around here confidentially.  Dworshak: Now don't get too discouraged on what I have told you. I have  been a little harsh in what I have said but I don't want to build up hopes  here. Wouldn't you rather have me tell you the truth than have Jordan  build your hopes up and then find out that you are living in a dream warld?  Mr. Curtis:  we all have  to you back  Well, Henry, I sure want you to tell us the truth, of course,  such a tremendous amount of faith in you that we kind of look  there as being the top of the hold deal.  Dworshak: Well I appreciate that - I have been talking to the Whitehouse  at least two or three times a week trying to knock their heads together  trying to get action this session. Now that is the way I felt a while ago,  I started in on this in March so we could get action in this session.  We have five weeks to go now - you can't get much done up here introducing  a bill in five weeks. We may do it, if the administration calls me up  tomorrow, I'll call you up - I'll check with them and tell you exactly  what they say.  Mr. Curtis: Call me collect Uenry.  Dworshak: 1 1 11 call you - I'll try to get a report tomorrow or Saturday  morring - will you be there Saturday.  Mr. Curtis - Yes.  Dworshak: I wished I could go with you on that trip.

Ch October 20, 1953, he mailed a memorandum  directed to ttAll 'WilcUife Federations and Depart:uent Personnel" call1ng  attention to the proroaed public hearing ond to the projects which \lould  be considerad, thereat.. This cOJ!llll1JDication to Mr. Leonard urged, direotly  and by implication, oppositIon to eny of the projeeta being considered.  \·lith out fJDy kno'...'lGdge of tlJIJ character of the projects, he stated that  I ..

HoVeV61",  l-h-. Leonnrd, or others responsible for dissemination of similar erroneous  data, have made no effort to correct the understandings f'urn1shed by him  to the recipients of hie momorend\llll of Octobor 20.  Nearly ell of the wildlife groupe which oppoee the projects are from  areas relatively remote from the proposed works and consequentlY' probably  have vory lim1ted knowledge of the character and scope of the effects of  the projects on fish, recreation and wildllte, with the exception ot that  fUrnished by Mr. Leonard. All of the recreation and hunting organizations  of the proj ect ercas, IIUlJlY members of which are dependent tor IIvel1hood on  hunting end recreetion activities, support the projects.

Spokesmen for  the intore.ts effected by the Alben1 Falls project have expressed unaltsrable  opposition to eny Corps of Engineers projects aeywhere, end have ,stated that  they will block llIlX projects of the Corps. It ie regrettable that their  attitude should constitute n throat to the economic welfare of the Clearwater  Region.

A(':cording to the report of' the Corps of Engineers, Brucee Ej~ reservoir  at Donna! pool level will have an area of 10,800 Berea or approximately  17 equare miles. Above the !hl1Ces Eddy dam the North Fork of the Clearwat.:Jr  River drains 2,440 square milcs. Thus, the total. reservoir area will be  spproximately .7 to 1% of tho drcinsge area above the demo After dedn&lt;oing  river bottom and rock. cliffs, the total possible area ranoved as 'brur"039 area  for elk tmd doer would be not mora then 1/200th of the area above t~e dam.

Mr. Robinson:  again Friday,  I went back.  WeIll finally got back. 1'. going back to Washington  tomorrow night and I thought I better give you a ring before  What did they decide about you going back as a witness?  Mr. Curtis: Well they think I should go back. Henry thinks I should go  back.  Mr. ~o~i9!on: When is that?  Mr. likfti..: The agenda, well I'm figuring on going back Saturday, I  .ill leave here Saturday night from Spokane and I will be in. of course.  Sunday and I am going to stay at (oh I forget the name of the hotel now)  anyway we have a conference with the Department of Interior Monday and  then the White House Executives, etc. on Tuesday. then the hearing before  the House Committee is on Wednesday and the Senate on Thursday.  Mr. Robinson: On Wednesday and Thursday, well I will be back there Monday  morning, I will be at the Mayflower Hotel and some of the rest of us will  be back there because we are going to be back there on our holding company  bill. They have a meeting on it Monday. then our Northwest Power conference  will be on Wednesday and maybe Thursday too, maybe that is the same time.  Mr. Curtis: Well that is the same thing, Wednesday must be a Houe comm~ee.  Mr. Robinson: Well fine, I'll probably be there both days then.  Mr. Curtis: Well that is fine. I'm just a little mixed up on this Herb West  thing a little bit. In talking the thing over with him he says well now you  fellows go along up there on this partnership you haven't got a chance. I  said well there isn't any use in me going back unless 1 can express the opinion  of the people here in Idaho. He said you should do that through indirect  testimony. Just what does he mean by indirect testimony.  Mr. Robinson: I don't know what he means. you would almost have to mention  it in your direct testimony or you wouldn't get a chance to get any questions  in.  Mr. Cu~tis: That is right - that is what I want to do - that is what I'm going  to do. There is no object in me going back, there is nothing there for us if  we can't get something here of a tax base for the people of the State of Idaho.  Mr. Robinson: That is right, I certainly would do it right in .y direct testimony.  Mr. Curtis: Well I certainly will. He wants me to endorse the Ice Harbor deal  which is alright. Let them have it if they want it. They want something on  flood control, navigation and Green Peter, Cougar and John Day project - those  are all fine, of course, we are in favor of all this development. But when it  comes down to. Idaho why we want something to ~ay in how it is developed. And  that is just what I want to say and that is what I'm goingto do, and I'm going  to take that bill of ours and toss it in their lap. I'm haVing it printed up  here. I'm haVing a hundred copies of it printed and I'm gotg to pass it to  everyone of them. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/313	313	314.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/314.pdfpage

On Green Peter and Cougar and John Day, I would say we are  all for them. we hope that they will get the maximum help out of local people.  That protects you all the way around and .n't hurt them. You see the City of  EUgene wants to build Cougar. that is they want to build the Power plant the  same as we do at Bruces Eddy and the Pacific Power and Light Company want to  build the power facilities at Green Peter. And, of course, there is a bill  already in Congrees on John Day to permit local people to put up 273 million  in power facilities and dam called the joint part of the dam and the Government  only have to put op $37 million for the navigation facilities.  Mr. Curtis: Now Kinsey isn't that John Day business authorized now for partner­ship.  Mr. Robinson: No it is authorized for Federal construction.  Mr. Curtis: It is on the federal construction basis?  Mr. Robinson: Yes and we are trying to get it de-authorize' for the other  type of construction. That is the Coon bill. You will get a lot of support  from that co~ittee. There will be one or two democrats that _ay kind of  nick you around, but I tell you the bulk of them will be all for it.  Mr. Curtis: Well I tell you when you have to talk to a guy like this fellow  Neuberger and people like that, why I don't know, it he is a disgrace t.  what he represents. Now do you have any other suggestions I should get into  my prepared material here, we are going to go pretty strongly, there is some  pretty strong statements here.  Ir. Robenson: ~Ol J think that is about all. Now I tell you I'll be here  at the Mayflower, you don't remecber what hotel you're staying in.  Mr. Curtis:.

Curtis  Mr. Robinson: Are you home now?  -  March 6, 1956  Mr. Curtis: Yes, I just come down to the office just for a few minutes.  Mr. Robinson: Harold Lucas called me this morning and said that the boys  were kind of pressing you on coming back and doing some testifying.  Mr. Curtis: Yes, that Is right.  Mr. Robinson: Well now, did I understand him right that they wanted you to  testify in connection with Bruces Eddy, Penny Cliffs and The John Day.  lIr. Curtis: Yesthat is right Kinsey.  Mr. Robinson: Well nos John Day now that must just be for appropriation.  Mr. Curtis: That is right, just for appropr18tio~  Mr. Robinson; It is already auth~ f'  Mr. Curtis: Yes, now Is that authorized for partnersbip?  Mr. Robinson: No it is authorized for Federal construction. That is the  reason that the/General and ourselves offered to put up the money to build  the power facilities with. We offered to put up $273.ooofooo and the govern­ment  put up the other $370,000,000 which is the power secret. We would have  to organize a corporation to put up the money and if "e did during the 3)  years we got power why we can pay back a lot more taxes to the federal govern­ment  than the $370,000,000. Now we are axxious to get that Coon bill passed  so that we can put up the money. How much appropriated are they talking about  now.  Mr. Curtis: Well now Kinsey, for this deal here which you are speaking of  is in support of the program for Bruces Eddy, Penny Cliffs and Ice Harbor  and John Day that is the entire program, of course, of the Waterways Ass'n.  ~3t they ask now is for authorization and then the same treatment of bruce·s  Eddy as given in the case of John Day, that is partnership features will  follow afterwards.  Mr, Robinson: Well if they ever authorize them for Federal Construction  without the provisions for partnership right in it. wefll never get them  de-authorized for partnership, that is the trouble.  Mr. Curtis: I see.  Mr. Robinson: In other words, Bruces Eddy and Penny Cliffs ought to have  a provision like that bill 1 sent you. In other words, that authorizes ~  for federal construction but gives that to work out the partnership. Now  if we donft get that and they ever get them authorized for lederal construction  we will never get them deauthorized to work out a partnership deal, ~  Mr. Curtis: Yes. well that is what is worrying me right now. That is my  concern right now, Now they ~ay that they canft g~~~~artnership through  right now and he thinks we should go through lor p~ership and then come  around the back door for partnership Bter. get authorization now and get  partnership later. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/316	316	317.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/317.pdfpage
Page 2									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														Mr. Robinson: You can't do it.  Mr. Curtis: You can't do it, huh?  Mr. Robinson: The only one that has been de-authorized for partnership is  the Priest Rapids and it was only because the Governor and all of the p~ate  companies and the public bodies went in there together and then we darned  near didn't get it through. So that I would think that as far as a private  company is concerned we were going in for de-authorization - now just between  you and lour friend Herb West does not want us " he does not want partnership.  He wants federal construction a.nd I will tell you one of the reasons why. I  don't know whether he is on the/Aluminum Co. payroll or not but he sure is  sure been playing to their gooO. Now Kyzer Aluminum is working their heart  out to get federal authorization. They want federal constrution of John Day  and they want it on Bruces Eddy and Penny Cliffs because that will give them  Bonneville Power that many more years than they think they are going to have  it now. So that there is a lot of diverted interests in this dar.ed thing.  We keep our fingers crossed on Herb all the time. He keeps telling me how  he is for it, but I know what he does in the committee hearings and one  thing and another and they are not good. So 1 would tell them that we ~uld  have no objection to going for in connection with Ice Harbor - all of us  has thought that ought to be a federal job since they started it. And I  would think that you could very well go along with the engineering money  because they have only got $500,000 I think for John Day and they need another  million or so for engineering. But I would say right in my testimony that  you would hope that the %)1. distributors of power, public am private wC1lld  put up the money to build John Day so that there would be federal money left  for the dams at Bruces Eddy and Penny Cliffs and then let the distributors  I wouldn't diferientate between private and public. What I would do if I  were you I would say that the distributors of power in the area build the  power plants, own and operate them and let the federal government own the  dams at Penny Cliffs and Bruces Eddy. Because I don't think you could db  it any other way. I would insist that on the authorization of it that me  (I would take that bill along) and say I have a bill here that I think muld  do what we want done for N«th Idaho. And that is to give a two year period  of partnership arrangement for the company to build the power plant, the  power facilties, o~n them and that leaves the government money to spend on  other dams and get the upstream storage that we really need.  Mr. Curtis: Sure, well now Kinsey if I go back there, they've been asking  me to come back, and If I go back, then what I should do is put that ricjJ t  in my prepared material and give it to them just that way. I'm hesitant  about going back. I just think that maybe I Shouldn't go back. And, of  course, they say that they have to have all the help that they can get to  meet this wildlife situation.  Mr. Robinson: Well I would tell them that you are prefectly willing to go  and help get more engineering money for John Day, t~hen appropriation f~  lee Harbor and get authorization for Penny Cliffs and Bruces Eddy with a  provision for private construction. of the power facilities.  Mr. Curtis: That is right.  Mr. Robinson:  would Url be  If they don't want you to go on that basis, then I think you  in trouble if you did go.  Mr. Curtis: I just can't go anyway wkaxith any conscious at all, I'. not  that kind of a guy. They know that - they should know it. So I just think  that is the way it will have to be Kinsey, but, of course, I may just go  up the Creek and not go at all up there. If they want to accept it that 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/317	317	318.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/318.pdfpage

Mr. Robinson: It will be a good way to put them on the spot and see where  in the devil they do stand.  Mr. Curtis: Well that is what I think too. Now I don't know what Herb  West is going to say. He called up yesterday again and he said that  Magnuson is very much in a hurry to get this thing underway. They are  going to reverse the prncedure this year - they are going to start the  hearing from our agency on the 26th and the week following the 26th.

Robinson: Now ~s for federal construction too yOll know.  He didn't want Priest Rapids to be on the right tax"X8K for a public  body to build it even. He is 100% for federal construction.  Mr. Cyrtis: Well in my script,In presentation, I will make that statement,that is  that/lAe only way that we will go on it. I think then that we will lea~ it  that way. Now alter Easter they are going to have the hearings fiDom the  agencies, like the Army Engineers, etc. He said it is in reverse lro. Ie  general procedure.

Now I was planning on being in Florida to make a talk on T~ sday  and I plan on being back in Washington on Wed. and Thurs. and I think I will  see Henry and talk to him.

Conference with Corpi of Engineers, Room 1223,  O.lldlng J--7 at Gravely Point.  le.Derl of Conference: Gener.} CharIe. Holle BDd Hand Armstrong at the Amly  Corps ot Engineers, Herb We.t, Charlel Baker, Herb Powell and Burt Curtis.  Herb West opened the conference by stating that $8,000,000 was needed for Ice  Harbor rathp.r t.han the $5,000,000 suggested in the bill. He stated that he  bad recently talked to some of the oontractors at Ice Harbor and they stated  that the first cofler dam would be in by January of next year which would use  the $5,000,000 and that $3,000,000 more should be available to continue the  project and not leave a short du~ation of time in which work could not go  forward because of lack at finance. The best way to plan these Federal ~ojects  is after they are started to get them completed as soon as possible. Genera'  I~lle concurred in this viewpoint and stated that additional money would be  very agreeable and highly desirable.  lest and Herb Powell pointed out that shipments of wheat out of the Lewiston  region would be big as soon as navigation was available and that Ice Harbor  would do a lot for navigation problems on the Snake, making water transportation  available to tbe ocean. He said that besides wheat, tbere would be other  agricultural products, forelt products, such 8S pulp and lumber, as well as  considerable lime as the Not'thwest developed. Ir. lest asked tile reason the  locks at Ice Harbor have been pla~ned smaller than locks on the aain stem of  the Colucbia River. lie also I3entioned that the handUnq of goods to sQUer  barges because of the smaller locks at Ice Harbor wIll be very costly and  unnecessary. General 1I0lle said he did not know why the Ice Harbor had been  designed smaller than the ones downstream Ind that it was an impu.tant subject  which should be seriously considered.  Some discussion came along shoreline property owned by tte Governroent making it  difficult for industry to locate in lome areal. It was mentioned that ~llips  Petroleum was thinking of a location in the Snake River area. General Holle  said that it was a real problem, but preferred private ownership ot shoreline  property to get the Government out of trouble in admtnistering .no should locate  where.  Lower IIonumental D811 wal discussed and whUe it bas been authorized lor S) me time  work should be gotten underway at tbe earliest poslible date. Mr. West mentioned  that _ would have to be in after construction IIIOney next year and that lb ere  ..uld be quite. job of .eliing on this project, He mentioned that $12 ~ 14  mllion dollars "ill be needed for relocation of railroads and so on at Ice  Harbor and $23,000,000 wal estimated to be necessary for the Lower Monumental  lite.  Tbe dams at Lord Granite, Little Goose should be started as one package job.  This will provide .lack water into Lewiston, Idaho. Mr. West stated that this  should come up at the earliest possible date to get the Snake River projects  all underway. Mr. Welt stated that 3B% of the money had been repai. to the  Government and that the Federal Investments have returned considerable moDey to  the treasury. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/359	359	360.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/360.pdfpage
Page 2									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														')  Upon being quizzed about the Libby Project, General Ho~le .tated tbat tbe  project i. taking repeated turns for the wnrst. Conferencel with Canada are  very 110w and action fro. Canadian authority 11 bard to obtain. Their position  on water dirverlion is important before the O. S. caD go ahead.  Bruce' EddT - Penny Clitr,: Some strategy was discussed in getting thee  projects underway. Curtis mentioned that Northwest Power company wal interelted  in Bruce's Eddy and the ~ople of the area telt very strongly on the importance  of local tax base. Herb West suggested that we might split the t~ projects up,  the Bruees Eddy going partnership and the Penny Clltts stralgbt Federal. Holle  did not know it this could be worked out or not and said he would refer this to  General Itscbncr. 8o11e mentioned that he knew of the local utility companies  desire to participate and Itrongly endorled tbat metbod of cODstruction. He  thought the best p-,.hology would be to get these two projectl underway in a  one package job. General Holle stated that be would have a talk ~th the power  companies and see what they thought about splitting them up, that we would  certainly need their cooperation to get anywhere.  A.B.C. give Cenerol Holle a copy of a partnership blli. He sold they looked  very good and liked the cooperation on this project. A.B.C. asked General  Holle if he had knowledge of letter tro~ Secretary of the Army Stevens regarding  tbe partnership possibilities. !be General mentioned tbat he bad written tbe  letter for Secretary Stevens, that It had originated in his office. I~ looked  upon the possibilities IS very favorable if the complextion of Congress ~uld  consider it favorably. I~ thought It ~~s a very iair bill sDd he would be ~ery  agreeable for the cooperation for this project. Fe stated that the language in  the billmlaht be checked,however. and that this was primarily a watter ot  importance to the local people. That the local people must hang together lor a  tax base project, and as long as we hod solid thinking in our area our biggest  hurdle would Le cleared.  Wildlife Discussion - Considerable 4iscussion was held on wildlife .atters which  have been so promJnent recently. The General mentioned that the -tldli!e feilowl  had gotten entirely out of line and very unreasonable. That they had looked into  ~ldllfe matters very thorougbly and were .ell satisfied that their contentions  did not bave a realistic solution to the problem. He Itated that it was very  important that we keep locol wildlife organizations in approval. Generally speak­ing  there was not too much to worry about the wildlife he did not think.  2:00 P.M. - INTERS'IATE COIIIlERCE COIIIIISSI~ - Honorable Owen Clar'" Commissioner.  IlIked Mr. west/about the 5% horizontal rate increase recently granted railroad~ Co..  • issioDer Clarke asked if It resulted in a loss of any business and the reply  to this was, it could not be immediately toreseen or determined.  The financial needs of the railways were discussed end it was .entioned that the  N.P. and U. P. possenger service revenue was bad. It was Qentioned st t~s time  by Commissioner Clarke that the freight revenue has tor lome time been used to  pay detic1 te inCllrred by passenger revenue.  64% of freight revenue is used for deficite of passenger.  Comadssioner Clarke mentioned that all r'~~%;ISof the U. S. had a revenue of fr~  6 to 9 kiliion dollars and tbat 700 million dollars Is the deficlte for passenger  service. It wu& presweed that the 700 million dollars would repreJ!nt 641 of the  paslenger deficite. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/360	360	361.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/361.pdfpage
Page 3									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														Generally speaking freight revenue subsidise passenger ousiness throughout the  country and the question is whether or not the public wants a public subsidity  for passenger revenue.  Agriculture pays tbe lower rate than other freight - 25% - of freight service  tonage. Ihe meaning here is that 25% of the tonage is agriculture, yet it pays  but 15% of the freight revenue. Comndssioner Clake mentioned also that coal  was 21% of tbe tonage, Jet calpays but 12% of the revenue. The tooage verses  revenue percentages in both agriculture Rod coal are t.. good examples.  Manufacturing cOCl""lOdi ty pay more freight revenue than others and have less  tonage. '~rentJoned such itees as vacum cleaners, washing machines, drIers  household itellS, etc. All oC which pay greater freight rates. Other I ten s of  the cigarette, c~ndy, etc. nature.  The question was asked why Should east Oregon be 5% less than in 1931 and the  Commissioner replied that there was a 20ne of r~~onable rates and that reasonable  rates to be defined properly must be something i~hereasonable cost. That is  the overall picture, but certain items may not be particularly compensatory.  It was brought out at this time that much tonaue in the lO?'er Knake River areB  will be by private carriers.  The CBr shortage Has discussed. COl!1llissioner Clarke mentioned that 145.000 cars  are on order but they will not be built in time to prevent a shortage '~ich will  develop in 1956. The caf builders simply cannot get this steel and are now opera­ting  at about 50~ capacity.  The Interstate Coomerce Commission has an order to stop slow schedules in ca~  moveMents, tbat the circuit routes must be stopped. '~noted th~t a good example  of this was in the case of oregon lumber going east where 390 days were consumed  in the routeing of the material to Ohio. In some cases cars In route have been  used for storage and this is ?ery ba4 and develops bad car shortages. Interstate  Commerce Oomnission bas orders out to stop such flagrant abuse. He said ~at last  year 1/3rd of all lumber from West to East was aD slow schedules. The comments  made bere were that freight rates must come down or private carriers wou~ be  doing the haulIng. I don't know who made the statement, but think it was Herb  West. Statements was also made that the movement from West to East by ralway  would have to get line with barge rates and trucks.  Co~issloner Clarke mentioned that the I.C.C. have only 30 car service agents in  the U. S. and that they need at least 50. They had over 100 during the Korean  War.  Waste car days Is bad. There~s some suggestion that 8 per diem charge of $27.70  by Magnuson be initiated. The present I. C.C. service order during Ihortages il  $2.40 per day. !bis meanl that the railway company with few cars can rent a car  cheaper than theJ can own It and that there is no incentives to buy ears. Tbe  rate may go to $25.00 a day which would be helpful to initiate car manufacturIng.  Some railways have 400% non-owned carlon their lines. Tbet COlt is about $8.000.00  to build a car today.

West. I presuDe he Junked thee all after reading theo nday evening to  find that they did not particLlarly help his Ice Harbor case.  It wa~ mentioned at this time that 26 million dollars were used at the ~Nary  nno (or fishing facilities and 22 million dollars were for naVigation.  It was mentioned here that money earned by Federal pDojects goes back to the U.S.  Treasury. Costs to operate the project must be reappropri~ted for operation.  $390,000,000 has been paid back already.  It was mentioned that ra~es may never be reduced even when a project is mmpletely  imortized.  11:00 A•• ClliFEllENC WITH SHEllIIAN ADAMS. ASSIsrAl«ETO TIlE PRESENT.

Sherman Adams promptly replied that the Federnl Government has  been putting Q lot of money into the Northwest nnd there was a limit on hw far  they could go end thought tbat local utility participation was ab.olutely  necessary in III cases pos.ible if we were to keep aD top ot the Job.

He wasn't just sure yet, but he was going to try and have a hearing on the  bill.

I was advised by legal council to proceed with all of my testimony, particularly  with th&lt;Jt of the taxation nature i r at all possible. And that I would not have  to fear the huoility of being taken ocr the witness stand. The thing to do  is not get scared and keep right on going to tell th~ e~mmittees what t~e  people want.  It was brought out that the Incal people in the cOl'!J!lunl ty mltlilt be steadfast in  their thinking nnd expressions on tile need of local participation. The mmplextion  ot the Congress at this til'e is not good for prIvate development.  Other ite~s n~re discussed for which no record should be ~ade.  CMEROCE WITH CONGRESSMAN BUIXiE  Considerable di&cussion was held with Congressman Budge, Herb Powell of Lewiston  accompanied me with this conference. Budge was very interested in the water  resources development in North Idaho and stated that he wished to be ns t.elpful  as possible. Some thought was given to he introducing a local utility participa­tion  bill and should such action by he be desirable it was our opinion that he  woukl cooperate.  A c~py of our bill Gnd testi~ny was left with Mr. Budge for his review. A  close oleck of our proposed legislation seemed good to Mr. Budge.  CMalENel WITH lEN JOODAN, anTED STATES CHAIRIiAN, IN,ERNATIll'iAL JOIN, CC*lIISSION.  About one and one-half hours was spen. with Len Jordan going over water resources  development. Of prime importance to us was the possibility of a utility partic-'­tion  in the Clearwater program. Jordan had done some research work for us since  I had talked to him earlier in the week. He mentioned that from 1906 to 1953  27 partnership projects had been completed in 13 5'les. 12 of these were by  republican administrations and 15 by democrat administrations.  He referred particularly to one or two of the more recent ones being the Coosa  River project in Alabama which tor many years has beeu Federally authorized but  no money has been allocated by Congress. Last year Sparkman and H11l. at ong  with all of the Alabama Congressmen managed to get 8 bill through Congress to  deauthorize the Federal Coosa River Project and permit a private utility, the  Alabama Power Compauy to proceed with the construction.  In other recent partnership project was in Oklahoma where the Grand River dam  was federally authorized many years ago. After a ten year wait for federal  money, last year the legislation was deauthorized and a Grand River Authority,  a state ot Oklahoma agenct wai permitted to go through with the constructiou.  Another more recent instance was the Niagra development in New York whim was  sponsored by Lehman to permit a local utility participation at Niagra.  Len Jordan thought that Henry Dworshak should show more fight in Congress and  if he would take the position of leadership could get a lot more done in  council with S~ some of his democratic friends. He feels that Henry has  taken a position of not desiring to fight or argue and perfers to have others  do the spade work so he cau move in on the easy jobs. He said he had taked  the matter over with Henry many times and was quite disappointed.  Other matters were discussed without records being made. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/366	366	367.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/367.pdfpage

I have bean &sB1gned a topic which covers a V8'r¥ important 1186,0009000 "a11-  Idaho project" in vater resource development. It would take a lot at time to  oover the entire field on what local people see in Bru08S Edd3'51 80 I vi 1 have  to discuss on.ly a few of the IllB113" i tams and present a general picture at the  a1tuation on Orofino and the surrounding region.  To properly present the picture at our struggle for progress in the Clearwater  valley, I think I should mention that Clearwater Count,. is largeq federal17  owned and the oounty has a mere approximate 1851 000,000 valuation with only a  little over 8,000 residents in the entire oount7 and aver 5,000 living here  in the Immediata. Oratino area. Our oommunity has an aoonon:ur pretty well built  up on f'orestr,r and logging activities. There ~ a few other activities here to  help along, such 8S State Hospital North, but principall,.. it is forestry and the  lumber industry. While this is true9 our region is one abounding in other  :resources as yet not working in teamwork and is out of balance in its effort to  effeot a stable eoonoUliY. There are many reasons why Orofino and ths Clearwater  country should take a big step forward in the next fey years and ocouPY' a  position of greater i~ortance in the societ,.. of Idaho citie8 and communities  with Congressional ap;:raval ot the project. For tI'lIlIlJ' years Bruoee Eddy bas been  one of' the great hopes of our people to take us further along the way of pro-viding  opportunities for the growth of our country wbiob 1f8 are told will oome  in a fey years hence vith expanding population. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/371	371	372.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/372.pdfpage

On the basis of present plans 98.4 miles of the shore  line property will be in private ownership, 44 milss of shore line in State of  Idaho ownership and 40.6 miles in U.S. Forest Service and BoLoN. ownership. We  hope that the shore line ownership status will remain in its present ownership  pattern, and the approximate 300 feet acquisition of additional acreage around  the perimeter of the proposed pool should be limited to tho~e shore line  properties now in public ownership.

He said 300 will be employed in 1964, 600 in 1965 and 1,000 in 1966.  Work thie: year, he noted, calls for completion of a three-lane  road to the dam along with coomencing an 1,800 foot tunnel through  which the road w1l.l run. Plane for 1964 are for beginning a diversion  tUMel. The year 1965, he said., will see the building of the coffer  dam and the letting of the $lOO-million construction contract, followed  by six years of construction 'WOrk. The last year ot construction in  1971 will still see 400 employed.  Lewiston Korning Tribune  April 9, 1963  COLFAX--Speaker Howard Preston, chief assistant engineer of the district  e~g'.nGering divi8ion, Walla Walla District of the A~ Corps of Engineers,  quoted the following population increase for Whitman County when construction  begins this year on Little Goose dam, and Lower Granite about 1965:  "225 total this year, 1,300 next year, 2700 in 1965, 4,000 in 1966,  4,300 in 1967, 5,300 in 1968, 4,300 in 1969, 2,530 in 1970 and 1,500 in 1m." 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/377	377	378.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/378.pdfpage

Fantastic  develop:1ent of our water resources seecs near at hand and is of  great importance to our part of Idaho.  Will be econan.1c lift - North Idaho - a new and vigorous empire!  Few realize the power potential and other  portant. The Colwnbia River Basin boasts  benefits are all i.m- v"  a potential of 42% of  ICE HARBER:  the nation's hydro capacity. Our part of this river system is  probably the least developed. The Clearwater and Salmon are thus  untamed. The upper and lower Snake are presentJ.y under develop-ent,  but the ndd-snake 1~ now in great controversy with inportant  developments close at hand!  I should start the discussion with the lower Snake since this is  Idaho water and it affects us very Ituch. The lower Snake d.a::ls,  four in number; Ice Harber, lower Monumental, Little Goose and  Lower Granite, will bring slack water to Lewiston, Idaho.  The navigation facilities mean much and affect our forests, agri-culture  and other products which will have a great promise to  reach markets that so far have been removed. Likewise, trans-portation  of bulk commodities into the region will be beneficial  to our econa:lY.  The lower Snake developnent is now well under way. The four  dam plan runs into a cost figure of over ~ billion dollars.  $555,000,000  Now here is a brief run down:  9 miles up the Snake from Pasco.

Here are some reasons for such kind of legislation.  Of the 239,500 fish migrants passing through the Nez Perce  site 172,500 or 72% will go up the Salmon River, 51,000 or  20% up the Snake with the balance of 16,000 up the Imnaha  River. From these records the importance of the Salmon River  as the principal migratory stream of the Columbia River  system cannot be minimized.  If the High Mountain Sheep project should be licensed for  private construction it should be equal in scope and purpose  to the project recognized by the Corps of Engineers, 1510'.  The amended. application of the Pacific Northwest Power Company  already has met with requirements in these respects.  \-then examined under the test of best comprehensive developnent  of that part of the Snake and Salmon Rivers the High MCI\m.tain  Sheep alone will have 3.1 nillion acre feet useable storage  and initial capability of 1,000,000 kilowatts and an ultimate  of 2,000,000 kilO\'Iatts at the site.

Page 3									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														DEVELOPMENT AND l1A.NAGEMENT OF Dvl0RSHAK RESERVOIR  FOR VARIOUS PUBLIC USES  Construction of Dworshak project was begun in 1963 under authority  contained in the 1962 Flood Control Act. The project is one component  in the comprehensive water resource development plan for Columbia River  and tributaries. It is designed for flood control and hydroelectric  pOlier production. with collateral benefits to recreation, log storage  and transport. and fish and wildlife.  The dam will be a straight-axis. concrete gravity structure. with  an effective height of 631 feet. It will impound a reservoir which will  extend nearly 54 miles into the rugged. timbered canyon of North Fork  Clearwater River.  After initial filling of the reservoir. now scheduled for spring of  1972. operation of the project will result in seasonal reservoir level  fluctuations vertically as much as 155 feet. In general, the reservoir  will be at or near the maximum full elevation of 1,600 msl during the  summer and will be dral~ down to near the minimum surface elevation of  1.445 msl in the early spring. A strip of Government-owned land of  varying width will be available for various uses related to the project.  A plan for orderly development and management of Dworshak Reservoir  shorelands is being developed by the Corps of Engineers. in cooperation  with other agencies. ~roups. and individuals. The overall plan has  progressed to the stage where tentative conclusions have been reached.  as shown on the map accompanying this notice. Neither these tentative  allocations nor the final allocations to be indicated in the reservoir 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/441	441	442.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/442.pdfpage
Page 4									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														plan are intended to be entirely fixed and unchangeable, but  rather are subject to modification, where and when justified, to better  meet the needs of the public and consistent with conditions that may  arise in the future.  The overall a~ or purpose of allocation of project lands for various  uses is to assure ult~te utilization of the various resources of the  project area, with maxLmum sustained benefits to the greatest number of  people. In allocating the Dworshak project lands, several broad cate­gories  of land classification are being used, as follows:  a. Project Operation.  These are lands required by the Corps of Engineers for  operation and maintenance of project structures or for care and manage­ment  of the project. Public access and use may be continuously or  periodically restricted or closely controlled for safety or security  reasons. To accommodate educational or other groups, inspection of  functional features not ordinarily open to the public may be arranged.  b. Public Recreation.  To implement the provisions of current Flood Control, Land  and Water Conservation, and Recreation Acts. project lands are made avail­able  for public recreational use and access. These areas are selected  on the basis of existing and potential demands for public access and  recreational use facilities. their desirability for and adaptability  to recreational use and development. and correlative consideration of  all other use demands and potentials. Public recreation land areas are  divided into four subcategories, according to their intended use and time  2 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/442	442	443.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/443.pdfpage
Page 5									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														of development. These are: Initial Development, Future Development,  Group Recreational Use, and General Access. Descriptions follow.  (1) Initial Development.  These are lands Which are developed or planned for  development as public park and recreation areas under the administration  of the Corps of Engineers or other Federal. state, or local governmental  agencies, or through commercial concessionaires within three years after  the project is placed in operation. No conversion to private or exclusive  group use of such lands will be permitted.  (2) Future Development.  These are lands having the same use capabilities and  development potential as Initial Development lands, but which are  reserved and designated for this use and development in the future.  Public entry and use without development might be expected and permitted;  however, no conversion to private or exclusive group use will be per­mitted.  Interim use for fish and wildlife purposes or leasing for  grazing and agricultural purposes is permitted, provided such interim  use will not adversely affect the public recreational values of the  area, and it is made certain that the land remains readily available  for the basic purpose for which it is reserved.  (3) Group Recreational Use (not now designated on land  use map).  Recognizing the need to accommodate non-profit  recreational-educational groups, it bas 10n3 been the policy of the  Corps of Engineers to make selected sborelands available for long-term  3 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/443	443	444.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/444.pdfpage
Page 6									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														lease to such organizations as Boy Scouts. Girl Scouts, Campfire Girls,  4-H Clubs, schools, churches, etc. As a result of prohlems arising in  certain parts of the country, where the number of groups far exceeds  the sites available, the Washington, D. C., office of the Corps of  Engineers is now re-evaluating the policy, with the goal of providing  more satisfactory group-use arrangements. One alternate is for the  Corps to develop and make group camp facilities available on a reserva­tion  basis. Group recreational use will be accommodated at Dworsbak  project, although the exact methods are not clear at this t~e. (The  matter ,r.LII be further discussed at the hearing and interested groups  especially will be invited to comment).  (4) General Access.  These areas, generally the steep shorelands around  the project, are not suitable or required for intensive development of  recreational facilities and are reserved prtmarily to assure free public  access to and along the shores of the project, or they may be utilized  for operational purposes, wildlife habitat, scenic and other resource  protection, and development of minor public recreational facilities.  Interim use for grazing or agricultural purposes is permitted, provided  such use will not adversely interfere with the above-prescribed uses.  Private cabin or exclusive group use of such lands will not be permitted.  c. Public Port Terminal.  These are shoreline frontage areas determined to be  essential to utilization of the navigational resources of the project.  Their prime purpose is to afford public or possible joint use space for  4 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/444	444	445.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/445.pdfpage
Page 7									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														transfer of logs and/or timber products. Lands are reserved for these  terminal sites at appropriate intervals along the shoreline, at points  strategically located in relation to existing and future potential  timber production areas, and logically related to the existing or  potential road systems serving these areas. These lands may be made  available for sale to states, political subdivisions thereof, port  districts, or port authorities, under provisions of Section lOB of  Public Law 86-645 (74 Stat. 486) or may be leased under a possible  joint public-private a$reement for development and use of handling and  transport facilities.  d. Industrial Use and Access.  These are areas of project lands not required for project  operation, public recreational use or access, public port terminals, or  fish and wildlife purposes. With appropriate restrictions as required  to satisfy project operational requirements, these lands may be made  available for sale to states, political subdivisions thereof, port  districts, or port authorities, under provisions of Section 108 of  Public Law 86-645, for development of private log handling facilities  or industrial uses requiring close association with the water area of  the reservoir, or they may be leased directly to such industrial users  in those instances where conveyance under referenced Section 108 of  Public Law 05-645 is not practicable or feasible.  e. Fish and l1ildlife (Project Acquisition).  In accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the  Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958 (Public Law 85-624), selected  5 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/445	445	446.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/446.pdfpage
Page 8									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														areas of project land are reserved for use in development and management  of the fish and wildlife resources of the project. These lands are  selected jointly by the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife and the  appropriate state fish and wildlife agency or agencies from those lands  determined by the Corps of Engineers to be available for such use.  f. Fish and Uildlife (Dig-Game Habitat Development Area).  In addition to lands acquired for basic project purposes  and public access, certain other lands have been selected as a result  of coordination with Federal and state wildlife a3encies and others,  for special development to mitigate loss of big-3ame habitat to be  inundated by the reservoir. Designated private and Federal lands are  to be developed and managed largely throush joint use agreements with  the State of Idaho. Some fee acquisition of private land may be involved.  6 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/446	446	447.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/447.pdfpage

The study is a portion of an overall review of the Columbia River and  tributaries developmental plan necessitated by recent developments and  changed conditions in the basin. One of the principal items of review  concerns the means of meeting electrical power demands during periods  of peak use.  Since the Lower Clearwater River will be affected by the operation of  Dworshak powerplant, which will begin operation in November 1972, studies  are neccHsary to determine an operating scheme that will be most beneficial  to all water resource and related environmental needs. Dworshak Dam  and powerplant have been designed to allow a considerable flexibility  in operation and water release. A number of alternatives exist.  In order to obtain the views and desires of all interested parties  regarding this matter, a public meeting will be held in Lewiston at 7:30 PH  on 22 October 1970 at the Hotel Lewis-Clark. In addition, informational  mee~s with concerned groups and individuals will be held prior to the  public meeting, if requested, to provide them an opportunity to become  better acquainted with the study purpose am objectives so they can  effectively participate both in the formal meeting and the ensuing  planning activities.  AUTHORI TY FOR STUDY:  The study iR authorized by a resolution of the Committee on Public Works  of the United States Senate, adopted 27 July 1962, which requested a  review of House Document 403, 87th Congress, 2nd Session, "Columbia  River and Tributaries," to determine whether any modifications of the  recommendations contained therein are advisable at this time, with  particular reference to further development of the land snd water resources  to meet anticipated regional requirements. The resolution recognized  the need to review and up-date the Columbia River Basin developmental  plan proposed in H.D. 403, due to the changed conditions since the  original plan was proposed. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/463	463	464.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/464.pdfpage
Page 5									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														STUDY OBJECTIVES:  One of the principal items of the review concernH the means for  satisfying periodic high demands (peaking needs) on the entire  Columbia River system. The demand for electrical power in the Pacific  Northwest region doubles about every twelve years. In order to meet  its future power needs, the region will have to shift from its reliance  on hydroelectr~ generation to a system composed of both hydroelectric  and thermal (nuclear or fossil fuel) generation. Thermal plants must  be constructed to meet continuous {base load) demands while the hydro  system will be operated primarily to carry peaking demands. In  connection with this, regulation of the Dworshak powerplant, as a  part of the regional hydro system,can require water flow releases  which could have a significant effect on the environment of the  Lower Clearwater River. Studies are therefore necessary to determine  the best operating scheme considering alternative impacts and various  beneficial uses.  To comply with the authorizing resolution, it will also be necessary to  consider other water resource needs in the area. A number of altern­ative  schemes will be investigated, including regulation principally  for environmental quality and possible future multipurpose development  on Lower Clearwater River. These studies will be coordinated with the  public and with interested agencies prior to submission of a report  in response to the resolution.  PRESENT CONDITIONS:  The Lower Clearwater River is used extensively for water-oriented recrea­tion,  principally steelhead and bass fishing, swimming, and boating.  The Clearwater River is impounded near Lewiston for power generation  and log storage. The Camas Prairie Railroad and U. S. Highway 12 are  located alongside the river throughout the reach under study. Several  small communities are located in the valley, and some irrigated  agriculture is carried on. The river furnishes municipal and industrial  water supply to Lewiston and water for irrigation. In the past, it  was used for a large annual log drive from the North Fork Clearwater  River to a forest industries mill at lewIston.  The natural fluctuation in the flow of Lower Clearwater River is  typical of snow-fed strea~; high flows occur from April through June,  with low flows during the remainder of the year. Occasionally, extremely  high flows cause floco damages at Ahsahka, Riverside, and Peck.  2 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/464	464	465.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/465.pdfpage

Fish ladders at the Washington Water Power Company Lewiston Dam. which  permit anadromous fish to migrate upriver. have permitted the Idaho  Fish and Game Department to successfully re-establish a salmon run that  spawns in Middle Fork Clearwater River and its tributaries. The present  steelhead run in the North Fork will be maintained through operation of  the Dworshak fish hatchery.  The Nez Perce Indian Reservation borders the river. The Nez Perce  National Historic Park is being developed in the area. with headquarters  at Spalding. Also. two state parks are located along this reach of  river; Spalding State Park at Spalding. and Lewis and Clark State Park  at Riverside.  FU1TIRE CONDITIONS:  After Dworshak Reservoir begins filling in 1971. the North Fork Clearwater  River. which contributes about 40 percent of the flow in the Clearwater  River below Ahsahka. will be subject to nearly complete regulation. The  high flows that occur on the North Fork during spring runoff will be  stored to be released during the normal low-flow seasons.  During the summer months. beginning in May. temperature stratification  will occur in the reservoir. This means that the warmer water will be  on the surface. and during August will reach a maximum of about 700 P••  while at depths of two to three hundred feet. and below. the water  temperature will always remain below 4SoP. The power penstock intake  system at Dworshak Dam is designed to permit the withdrawal of water  from the reservoir at any temperature between these two extremes. By  proper selection, it will be possible for water releases to approximately  match the natural temperatures in the main stem of the river during the  months from March through October. Alternatively, if the reservoir  withdrawals were nsde only at the lower levels. the natural maximum  summer water temperatures in the lower river could be reduced by about  130 Pj from 7SoP. to 62°F. Temperature variation alternatives at the  dam can be used to achieve differing environmental effects downstream  on Lower Clearwater River. During winter months the releases would  be about Sop. to lOOP. warmer than the natural river temperature.

Consequently, if powerptant peaking operation is unrestricted,  the discharge could fluctuate rapidly between these two extremes, and  result in a change in water level in the Clearwater River below the  mouth of the North Fork up to a maximum of about 3 feet.  It is the policy of the Corps of Engineers to operate its projects to  provide optimum multipurpose benefits for all beneficial purposes. To  carry out this policy the study will consider all effects of power  operation so reasonable decisions can be reached that make best use of  the water resource. It will be one of the principal purposes of this  study to determine the degree of constraint desirable at Dworshak,  both from the standpoint of downstream environmental factors and pawer  production.  LONG-RANGE NEEDS:  A further study objective will be to consider the overall water resource  needs of the Lower Clearwater River Basin. These will include the 1008­range  needs for additional flood protection, irrigation, municipal and  industrial water supplies, water quality control, navigation, fish and  wildlife enhancement, recreation, and power. It is important that any  proposed operational scheme considers all water resource needs, present  and future.  One future regional need that is already evident is for additional pawer.  In anticipation of this need, the ~orshak project is being constructed  with provisions for three future generating units. If, and when,  these are installed, the total generating capacity would be increased to  more than double the initial installation. Since the future units  would be most effective for peaking purposes, their unrestricted use  could cause fluctuations up to 7 feet in downstream river levels as  power output is varied. The need for full peaking capacity usually  occurs in mid-winter, but the resultant river level fluctuations may be  large enough to require some degree of discharge control to prevent  damage to downstream river environment and to integrate possible water  releases with the basin-wide river system. The study will, therefore,  review this situation. The estimated economic benefits that would be  foregone if the future power units are not installed, and/or the  operation restricted, will be compared with the estimated social and  the environmental values of the river.  PERTINENT STUDIES:  There are, at present, several investigations underway that will provide  data to evaluate the effects of ~orshak operation on the downstream river  environment.

Water quality samples are being analyzed  monthly by the Corps of Engineers, and continuous water temperatures  recordings are being made at several locations. The Idaho Water Resource  Research Institute at the University of Idaho under contract with the Corps  of Engineers, is preparing an environmental impact report that considers  both present and potential uses of the river and associated land resources.  The findings of this report will be presented at the public meeting in  October.  PUBLIC PARTICIPATION:  It iH not only desirable. but necessary. that the public participate in  the planning process to insure that all water resource needs and desires  are afforded proper consideration. All interests are therefore encouraged  to express their views at the public meeting. and at any time during the  study period.  This pamphlet has presented a brief description of the study purpose, its  needs, and its objectives. }wny questions will remain unanswered. and  for that reason. it is proposed to hold public and group informational  meetings prior to the public meeting. The purpose of these meetings  will be to provide information that is now available and to discuss  possible alternatives for the optimum powerplant operation and water  flow releases. Any group or individual may request such a meeting by  notifying the District Enginee~ Corps of Engineers, City-County Airport.  Walla Walla. Washington 99362, or by calling Chief of Planning Branch,  Area Code 509·525-5500, Ext. 308.  The formal public meeting will be held in Lewiston on 22 October 1970.  At that time any individual may present a statement for the records  0xpressing his views and desires. Other meetings will be held during  the study as the need arises. Inquiries regarding the study may be  addressed to the District Engineer at any time, and every reasonable  effort will be made to provide answers.  5 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/467	467	468.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/468.pdfpage

Idaho  by Mr. Don Thomas on 28 and 29 September 1971)  The North Fork of the Clearwater River has been dammed. A huge, ugly  concrete plug has been inserted into the beautiful river canyon to still  forever the sound of 8 living, running river. There is nothing that can  be done about tr.~ projettnow, it's virtually completed. If, instead of  being in the final stages of construction at this moment in history, it were  in the planning stages, it would neve get off the table. But it was planned  nearly twenty years ago, built on a foundation of greed, broken promises and  deception. It will stand forever a monument to • bunch of fools. This is a  dam that is probably the most unsavory history of any project ever attempted  in the U S. And we would be willing to bet money, marbles and chalk that  once filled and emptied the people of the Northwest will rise in such indig-nation  at the obscenity that has been placed on North Idaho, the drawdowns  will be 1imite1 and the levels stabilized. In going over our files on Dworshak  Dam, we find that in all the testimony by the Corps of Engineers before the  appropriation committee, the almost sole justification for the dam was for  flood control. According to the head of the Corps of Engineers at the time  they were seeking funds for the dam, the Clearwater River is a major producer  of flood flows in the Snake River basin. In the past one hundred years we  have records of two floods, only one of which did any damage, and that was at  the turn of the century and the records are sketchy as to what the damage was  that may have occurred at that time. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/474	474	475.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/475.pdfpage
Page 2									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														/  /  r  What are we gaining that!. half 80 precious 8S what Idaho 1s 108ing?  Some flood control, perhaps. But at least five other dams have gone into  the Snake basin since Dworshak Dam was started. Other dams have gone into  the Columbia too, including it's headwater. So this, what was to be it's  major justification, can hardly be that any more. We'll get 8 little power  from it but not much. And what will we trade for these so-called benefits?  We'll give up the most beaufitul scenic area. in the United States, winter  range for our declining elk herds. we'll lose thousands of acres of rich  timber producing land, we'll quite likely lose the sawmill and the plywood  plant in Lewiston, and we'll trade a natural and self·perpetuatlng steelhead  salmon and resident fishery' resource for a costly tax supported artificill  system of propagation. The interests who promoted the dam have pocketed their  goodies by now. The damages the dam will do are just starting. It's another  example of the things our people can point to as they label us for all time,  the generation of spoilers. And that's Viewpoint at this hour.  2 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/475	475	476.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/476.pdfpage

It's one of the most influential and certain-  Iy it is one of the moat accurate in it's reporting. It's with interest that  many people will have noted that it deviated some from it's standard format on  Tuesday, September the 23rd to carry a full page on it's second most important  news page to review a book to be released next month. The book, Dams and Other  Disasters, A Century of the Army Corps of Engineers in Civil Works, by Doctor  Arthur E. Morgan. Of his book Dr. Morgan write. in his preface, "I have not  made the record. I merely recor4 it. 1t  At a time when the Corps is being made the subject of many articles on  it's bungling, this book is certainly one of the most damning. It's subject  and it's publication at this time should be a matter of thoughtful reflection  on the part of residents of Lewiston, as this same Corps is about to start a  highly questionable project of an engineering nature that they have never success-fully  completed before, and in so doing are about to burden the residents of  Lewiston with a massive tax load. not only to mitigate the damage they will do.  but also inflict on the citizens of this city a continuing tax load from this  time on, and we refer, of course, to the diking project.  Here, for sober reflection, are some excerpts from the book by Doctor  Arthur Morgan. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/477	477	478.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/478.pdfpage
Page 2									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														"There have been over the past one hundred years consistent and disastrous  failures by the Corps in public work areas. These failures have resulted in  an enormous and unnecessary cost to ecology, the taxpayer, and the people whose  culture, homes and land has suffered under the control of the Corps. Further­more,  throughout it's career, the Corps has persistentlywoided or prevented  objective appraisal of projects while at the same time presenting itself to  the public as unequalled in it's field. The public has remained ignorant of  the quality of it's work. I have made numerous criticizms both of the ethical  character and the engineering competence of the Corps of Engineers. I have  described those characteristics as not being occasional lapses from a generally  high level of character and achievement, but a. fundamentally characteristic  of the Corp•• "  The author points out the most atrocious ecological tragedies in the  history of America have been perpetuated by the Corps and notes that they were  the only authority to prevent pollution in our rivers, yet in seventy years  have done absolutely nothing about it. In view of their record for deliberately  misleading the public and of their imcompetence, it would seem prudent for  Lewiston city leaders to stop any further plans of the Corps for diking downtown  Lewiston. It's our city, our money, our land, and our future that they want to  experiment with. And their record hardly merits such confidence.  That's viewpoint at this hour. 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/478	478	479.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/479.pdfpage

Cronk & Associates  100 Bush St., San Francisco, Ca.  ilione Cronk - (415) 434-1894  FACT SHEET - Dworshak Dam, Orofino, Idaho  Second Highest Concrete Dam in the U. S.  D'W"orshak Dam, now being constructed on the North Fork of the  Clearwater River near Orofino, Idaho, will be 6)3 feet high., the second  highest concrete dam in the U. S. (Hoover Dam is 726 feet high.) It  is a U. S. Army Corps of Engineers project. As part of the Columbia­Snake  River vater resources development program, it vi11 provide flood  protection, electric power, navigational and recreational benefits.  The dam will be 3,300 feet wide at its crest. It will be of con­crete  gravity design, requiring 6.7 million yards of concrete. It  will take seven years to construct the entire project, including the  power house, at a total cost of approximately $250 million. Site  preparation began in 1965.  'lb.e $13l-million contract awarded for construction of the dam is  the largest ever let by the Corps.  fue power house, to be built under a later contract, will house  three generators inltial.ly, producing 400,000 kv. Ultimately, it may  house six units, generating 1,060,000 kw.  The reservoir will extend 53 miles upstream and cover an area of  17,000 acres. Its water storage capacity will be 3.5 million acre-feet.

Groves & Sons  Coq&gt;anyJ M1.nDeapol1s, Minn.; C. H. Leavell Company, El Paso, Tex.;  Fishback & Moore, Inc., Los Angeles, Ca.lif.; and D-K-C Constructors,  Spokane, Wash.  The Corps at Engineers designed the project and 1s administering  it through its Walla Walla District and a lOO-man field office at  Ahsahka, near the site.  'lhe dam contract also called for excavation of nearly 2 million  yards of COmIOOn dirt and L 8 million cubic yards of rock on the dam  and quarry sites, construction of 2t miles of roads around the project  and building of a visitors center.  Newsworthy Construction Methods  The contractor 1s utilizing a number of techniques on the D.oIorshak  Job which are unique:  l} Fast Cablewaya  Dravo 1s placing the 6.7 mll.l.1on cubic yards of concrete in tile  dam by means of three very fast cableways. These cabl~s, stretch­ing  2,915 feet across the river gorge, have been designed to carry  8-yard buckets of concrete f"ran the batching plant to the dam site.  All. three cablews\ys are mobile. Head and tail towers are mounted  on a 740-foot-long track to permit cOOlplete coverase of the dam site.  One of the cableways was transferred f"ran Mossyrock Dam in central  Washington, where it set the current world's record for concrete  placement with a single cableway. The others have been constructed  to Dravo specifications by Washington Iron Works of Seattle.  '!hey are des18ned to carry a bucket and load weighing a total of  25 tons at a speed of 2,200 feet per minute across the main gut  and to lower it to the dam site at 950 feet per minute. The main  gut, by U. S. Steel, is 3! inches in diameter.  A comprehensive system of controls and cOIIlllllDlcation bas been de­veloped  for cableway operation. Dravo has installed television  camera survei1lance of the dam site so that operations can be lOOn­ltored  by the cableway operator in his control house and by the  project manager in the field office. A two-way radio system will  be employed aJ.so, to provide conmnmicatlon between the cableway  operator and the dam site, and between the project headquarters  and vehicles.  General Electric lOOters are used to power the cableways. The  three 8-yard buckets were manu:tactured by Blaw-Knox.

'!he contractor has developed a quarry on a promontory  1,200 feet above the dam. He has excavated into the mountain fioom  the quarry site and constructed an underground chamber in 'Which  equipment has been installed to crush the quarried rock. This  chamber 1s 82 feet long, 32 feet wide and 102 feet high.  The rock 1s chuted down to the chamber through a 420-foot-long  vertical shaft 20 feet in diameter. After it is crushed to minus  6 inches, it 1s carried outside by means of a conveyor belt  through a IO-foot diameter tunnel, 750 feet long.  Although this technique has been used in mining, this 1s a first­time  application in construction.  The equipment required in the crushing chamber 1s massive. At  the bottom of the shaft, a National Iron Company apron feeder 10  feet wide by 26 feet long (driven by two 40 h.p. 4-speed motors)  feeds quarry rock as large as 4 feet in diameter to a 54-inch by  SO-inch gyratory crusher (Nordberg Manufacturing Company) driven  by a direct connected 500-h.p. motor. This crusher reduces the  rock to minus 15 inches. The material tlOW'ing out at the bottom  of the crusher is split by two F-98 Syntron feeders. These dis­charge  over two Simplicity screens to take out the minus 6-incb  material. 1he oversize feeds directly into two Nordberg 5!-foot  standard cone crushers. These crushers reduce the rock to minus  6-inches. This rock, plus the rock removed by the screens, is  then collected by a 54-inch conveyor belt and moved to a transfer  point where a 48-inch conveyor belt 750 feet long and driven by  a 500-h.p. motor takes the rock to a surge pile outside. From  there it is carried into an aggregate plant, where it is processed  into aggregate of various sizes and sand. The crushing plant was  designed to Dravo I s specs by Bullock Engineering, Inc., of Denver.  3) Aggregate Plant  '!he outside aggregate plant 1s capable of producing 1,600 tons of  aggregate of various sizes per hour. It is being operated under  subcontract by Curtis Construction Company of Spokane, Washington.  In this plant the crushed rock is screened, washed and crushed  again into the various aggregate sizes required - 6 to 3-inch,  3 to l~-inch, l~ to 3/4-inch and sand.  The plant is designed with two separate circuits so that a failure  will not bring operations to a halt. One circuit consists of two  Nordberg 5-foot short-head cone crushers and a 4i-foot standard  (more) 			2011-03-15	2011-03-15	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/504	504	505.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/505.pdfpage
Page 4									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														4  cone crusher for reduction at rock to the required aggregate sizes.  The other circuit consists of eight 54-inch Nordberg Gyrod1sc crushers  for production of sand.  A Syntron vibrating feeder and a Simplicity 6 x 12-foot double­deck  screen are employed with each crusher.  A closed-circuit television camera 1s mounted directly above the  throat of the crusher so that operators in the plant can tell if  material 1s flowing evenly into it.  Some 43 conveyor belts of various sizes are employed to carry  aggregate through the plant. (Flow diagram available on request.)  The conveyor belts used to carry the aggregate to the batch plant  were furnished by Star Line Equipment Company of Boise, Idaho.  4) Quarrying Qperations  It was necessary to strip 2 million yards of unsuitable, weathered  material !'rom the quarry area before suitable rock was obtained.  The quarry 1s being worked in 45-f'oot benches. The rock is blasted  into minus 4-foot size, loaded into lOO-ton KW Dart trucks by a  P & H electric shovel with l4-yard Esco bucket, and dumped into  the shaft to the crusher.  Tw'o 12-inch Robbins drills are being used in the quarry - an RR 12  and a new RR l2E (electric). Anmonium nitrate prill is being used  for explosive.  5) Six-Mixer Batcbing Plants  Two large C. S. Johnson batch plants, standing 135 feet high, are  employed to produce approximately 10,000 yards of concrete per day.  One is equipped with six 4-yard mixers and the other with four.  Al.l weighing and mixing of sand, aggregate, water, and cement is  automatic. Cement storage requires eight silos, (1,300 barrels)  and pozzolan another four silos. Both materials are handled pneu­matica.  lly, employing an air injection system.  Concrete is carried from the batching plant to the cableway loading  dock iD. three 2-hopper rail cars. Each hopper carries enough con­crete  to fill one eight-yard bucket.  A system of radio controls has been installed to switch the tracks  remotely and permit movement of all three cars simultaneously be­tween  the batch plants and cableway loading dock.

Page 5									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														5  6) Ref'rigeratlon System to Meet Stiff Cooling Specs  Dworshak Dam Constructors spent ::;1. 2 million for ref'rigeration  equipment to cool aggregates and concrete mix to the Corps' spec­ifications  (no warmer than 45° F. during the first hour in the pour).  Normal summer heat at the Dworshak Dam site is 800 F. To bring  the temperature of the aggregate and sand down to the specified  450 F. and keep it there during mixing and placing requires a var­iety  of cooling measures. '!hese include cooling the coarse ag­gregate  with chilled water (35° F.), cooling the air in the batch  plant, and adding flaked ice to the mix.  Some 280 pounds of ice will be used in each four-yard batch of  concrete. Twelve ice-making machines will be required to produce  the necessary total of 360 tons of ice per day.  (Details on refrigeration equipment available on request)  7) Starlight System to Light Dem Site  To flood the dam with light during the night and permit workmen  to work around the clock requires a system comparab1e to that  needed by a small tovn.  lJJle cableway and dam. site are lighted from tva starlight systems  spanning the river gorge on cables 3,800 feet long, from tower to  tower.  Towers for the upstream line are 105 feet and 236 f'eet high -  both anchored in huge concrete blocks. A total of' 440 flood lights  are hung on these two starlight cables 1 each one producing 1, 500  candlepower. Together they produce an illumination of' 2 foot­candles  on the dam site.  The starlight cable 1s 2-~inch Bethlehem high-strength steel. The  electrical equipment was manufactured by General Electric Company.  The dollies carrying the lights were made by Washington Iron Works  of' Seattle.  Manpower Requirements  D..1ring the height of construction, some 1 , 200 construction men will  be employed on the project. Payrolls are expected to reach $220,000 a  week.

Here you see the right angle turn of the river. Just below this is the location of the structure to be as you will later see. The little foot bridge across the river went over to the Merry place. People who lived on the little farm that you will note. The road went from Orofino to Dent, upstream some 20 miles. In far distance, downstream, you will see Ahsahka (just a little of it) and the Riverside area of what became later a part of Orofino.""	1963	Curtis, Bert, 1903-1985; Idaho -- Dworshak Reservoir; Dworshak Dam (Idaho);	Dworshak Dam Project; 1963	PG 13	University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives, http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections	University of Idaho Library Digital Initiatives, http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/	http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/	PG 13, A.B.

Dworshak Dam Project 2 (Possible bridge sites)		Possible bridge sites and relocated county road. Note on back: ""During the planning stages we wanted a bridge across the main river just below Ahsahka. It was to be an Army construction type of bridge and we were working with the State Highway  to get it to be a bridge for public use. Army wanted it to haul  cement and route for workers to come to the job- a saving for labor transportation, etc. The state was to put some money into it and make it a public bridge, the Army wanted to tear it down after construction. To make a long story short, the state was willing but the Army backed out of the deal and elected to divert the travel across the bridge at Orofino rather than go to the expense of a new bridge. The markings are Army. This shows the forks of the river well. (A.B.

The con­stTuction  of Libby involves costs in  Canada for flowage and Telocations.  Use of this area. head and water  means use of a Canadian resource  for the generation of power al-site  and downstream. as well as for  otheT purposes. How much of a  share has yel to be deteTminted.  D. Miu Creek and Arrow Lakes  are potential developments located  entirely in Canada. As investigated  by the Canadians. I believe both  projects are economically mcasible  bUl the full measure of theiT feasi·  bility depends on the benefits which  accrue downstream in the United  States.  Here the problem again is how  shall the costs and benefits be  shared to the best advantage of the  countries. This is a malter that  must be negotiated by the two  countries and one which is present­ly  under study by the International  Joint Commission.  E.

To this was added  an equivalent of about 2J)OO,OOO  acre feet to represent the irri,gation  depleUons now forecast of about  1985.  Navigo,tion To Lewiston  Before I· close I must s'ay a word  about navigation. Our current stu­dies  include consideration of ex­tending  slackwater navigation far­ther  upstream on both the Snake  and Columbia Rivers.  For the Snake, it appears that  adjustment in the authorized Low­er  Granite project will improve. the  navigation facilities at Lewiston  and permit the elimination of the  low Clarkston dam previously con­templated  just above Lewiston.  Consequently a single dam at A 0­tin  would provide slackw·ater to  Lime Point, Idaho, (just above the  mouth of the Grand Ronde River).  On the Columbia above McNary  extended economic studies include  a possibility of justifying naviga­tion  to Rock Island. Such an exten­sion  would require open river im­provements  to the foot of Priest  Rapids D'am and locks at both  Priest apids and W·anapum. If  a dam is cons,truc,ted in the reach  between McNary and Priest  Rapids, an additional lock will  be required and this possibility is  being studied.  At Bonneville s,tudies are being  m'ade to determine whether a  larger lock should be p'ro,vided at  ,this time to make thIS lift com­parable  with the locks upstream.  As you may remember, Bonneville  lock was constructed with dimen­sions  of 76 feet by 500 feet with a  24-foot depth over the sills at low  water to serve in the 27-foot chan­nel  to The Dalles. The upstre'am  projects are designed for barge  traffic with dimension of 86 x 675  feet with 15 feet over the sills. The  smaUer area at Bonneville will re­quire  the larger barge tow that  could move through the upper  reaches to be broken up for lock­age.  ConsequenHy, navig,ation in­ter  a urged consider·ation  of a new lock.  I hope tha,t we can look forw'ard  Ito working fur,ther witJh the Inter­state  Compact Commis ion as our  report nears completion. If all goe  well and adequate funds aTe made  av·ailable this year, the report  should be completed on schedule  by Jnne 1958. 			2011-04-05	2011-04-05	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/725	725	726.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/726.pdfpage

Page 1									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														A collision of committees of the Senate  and the House of Representatives, may  well decide within the next few days the  fate of Bruces Eddy dam and other Co·  lumbia Basin projects pending in this  session of Congress.  Bruces Eddy dam on the North Fork  of the Clearwater River and Burns Creek  dam on the Upper Snake River were  pecifically mentioned as targets yester­day  as the House Rules' Committee chair­man  called for war to the death against  numerous projects approved for authori­zation  by the Senate. What the other tar­gets  may be depends in part upon the  standards finally adopted by the House  to guide its attack upon the Senate. As  vaguely defined yesterday, those stand­ards  could possibly doom all Columbia  Basin projects awaiting authorization in  the Senate-approved omnibus bill.  It is discouraging and even disgusting  to ordinary citizens to see as worthy a  project as Bruces Eddy dam caught in  the whirlpool of personal, partisan and  institutional angers which dominate clos­ing  sessions of Congress. But they should  try to glimpse at least some of the main  currents contributing to the whirlpool.  One force is the personal ambition of  committee chairmen of Congress - and  even of the professional committee staff  members who sometimes guide their  elected bosses on key committees.  Rep. Howard W. Smith, D-Va., is one  of the most power-conscious members of  Congress. As chairman for many years of  the potent House Rules Committee, he  has endeavored to govern the content of  legislation from his strategic position as  well as direct the flow of bills through  Congress. The House endeavored in the  last session of Congress, with consider­able  prodding from the Kennedy admin­  ·stration, to reclaim some of the power  usurped by Smith. His committee was en­larged,  and some progressive blood was  pumped into it. But Smith retains enough  .authority to k·ll almost any bill in Con­gress  if he can plot his moves carefully  enough. He is plotting his moves against  the omnibus river development bill WIth  studious care.  Yesterday Smith questioned indivi­dually  members of the House Public  Works Committee about how they would  stand· th we t ast House confe ees to  negotiate with Senat representatives  over difference between House and Sen­a  versi ns of the omnibus bill. He won  the promise of two Republican members  that they would refuse to accept any "con­troversial"  enate additions to the House-pproved  project list. A Democratic con­feree  likely to be chairman of the House  group also assured Smith he would op­pose  objectionable Senate-endorsed proj­ects.  Only after Smith had received such  promises did he agree to allowing the·  House conferees to meet with the Senate  ,onferees at all.  Smith mdicated he might ask the en~  tire House to endorse a rule instructing  its conferees exactly how far they might  go in negotiating with the senators. If  the House votes to restrict its conferees  ·n this fashion then the Senate has little  ecourse but to accept the best terms the  House rule permits - then retaliate  'agai e House-beloved program. If  Wed., Oct. 10, 1962  the House conferees are permitted to ne­gotiate  without a formal House rule ­but  only under the stern injunctions of  Smith's committee - then a measure of  g e n u i n e compromise might yet be  achieved. I  Even in that event, some worthy proj­ects  certainly are going to be scuttled on  one or another of the shoals clearly visible  already. \  A basic hazard is the jealousy between  the House and Senate. The House mem­bership  certainly will reflect - though it  will not duplicate in the same absurd de­gree  - the rules committee's resentment  that the Senate presumed to add to the I  omnibus bill projects which the House had  not been asked to consider (as in the  Bruces Eddy case) or had previously re­je~  ted (as in the Burns Creek affair). ~  Sponsors of many types of legislation pre­fer  to deal with the relatively orderly and  responsible Senate rather than with the  fractionated and often chaotic House.  House members know this - and 'often  resent it.  Another hazard is sectional rivalry.  Many members of Congress - particu­larly  in the House, where representation  is on a mostly local basis without the di­rect  national responsibilities inherent in  the Senate - fear and mistrust further  river development in the Pacific North­west.  They seize upon any division in the  region itself (and 'some areas of the  Northwest provide them with unending  excuses) or any arguments even super­ficially  sound to justify opposition to this  region's projects. Authorization for fu  ture Northwest projects once was rela­tively  easy to obtain in Congress. Now  'it is increasingly difficult  The old public versus private power  specter still is horrendous enough to  frighten congressmen by the score when­ever  it is revived by the lobbyists. Bruces  Eddy is not involved in this political caul­dron,  but Burns Creek is - quite irrele­vantly  and unfairly - and China Gardens  may be.  Partisan struggles often are para­mount  in these congressional blood-letting  ceremonies, especially in election years.  Burns Creek dam almost certainly will  fallon this account, regardless of what­ever  other burdens it bears in Congress.  In a recent test vote only seven Republi­c  n members of the House voted for this  project and 121 voted against it. Obvious­ly  the Republican party, including many  Republicans in Idaho who favor the Burns  Creek project, have decided to do all they  can to kill it rather than give the Demo­crats  any excuse to claim credit for its  uthorization. No river development proj­ect  can expect to survive all the normal  hazards in Congress, plus such single­minded,  party-line opposition, too.  All of thes forces and more will be  involved somehow or other in the tug-of­war  between the House and Senate over  the omnibus river projects authorization  bill. And always in the foreground will be  the tempers of hurried, harried, exhaust­ed  lawmakers struggling to close up their  congressional affairs and adjourn.  What will come out of it nobody knows  as yet, but great skill and good fortune  may well b~ required to bring out f it  authorization for Bruces Eddy, Asotin or  any other Northwest dams. - B. . 			2011-04-05	2011-04-05	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/844	844	845.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/845.pdfpage

It ap­•  ceared dead at least for this session of Congress. . The House Interior Reclamation Subcommittee turned· down a bill to authorize a single  multi-million dollar high federal dam in the Snake River bordering Idaho and Oregon•.  ,~~~=~==~~~-------.....-...;..-----~-- ~ Republicans claimed that with  the help of two Southern Demo­crats,  they had killed the bill, al­ready  passed by the Senate.  A leading advocate conceded it  probably was dead, but said the  fight would be carried on in the  next session of Congress.  The proposed Hells Canyon fed­eral  dam, which has been before  Congress about six years, would  flood the sites of three smaller  dams which the Federal Power  Commission has authorized the  Idaho Power Co. to construct in  the same stretch of the. Colum­bia  River tributary. One of these  three dams is nearly built and  a second is under construction.  The subcommittee voted 15-13 to  report the bill adversely to the  full Interior Committee. The 13  Republicans who voted against the  bill were joined by two Southern  Democrats, Reps. James A. Haley  (Fla) and George A. Shuford  (NC). The 13 voting for the bill  were Democrats.  Later Motions  Later, on motions introduced by  Rep. A. L. Miller (R-Neb) the I  group rejected- a move to recon­sider  and then voted to table the I  reconsideration request.'  Mill-er told a newsman this suc­cessfully  buried the bill because  now a two-thirds vote is required  in any move, to reconsider the  Hells Canyon bill, either in the  full committee or subcommittee.  Rep. Wayne Aspinall (D-Colo),  subcommittee chairman, indicated  he too considered the bill dead. He said the adverse subcommit­tee  report probably would be per­mitted  "just to lie there" and die  officially at the end of the' cur­rent  congressional session.  Rep.

Itschner, chief of the armyeot}&gt;$,  of engineers forecast prompt action on pre-construe  I  tion plans.  "Language must be inserted in the current appropri­t  ation bill in congress, or in the  ""')report of the bill by the appro-priation  committee, to permit  spending of $500,000 already al­loted  by congress a year ago for  t drawing of deta11ed project  Plafls" the general told Orofino  W: f Resource committee mem-  Itk and staff members were  hOJ\f;)r . guests at a luncheon at  the VFW building which fol­lowed,  an inspection of the pool  area."  Colonels Here  Also guests were Colonel My­ron  Page, Walla Walla district  engineer and his successor after  IAug. 4, Col. P. H. Symtol; Divi­sion  Engineer Allen F. Clark of  Portland and Col. W. P. Leber,  executive officer to General  Itschner, all who were in the of­ficial  party.  General Itschner said that as  soon as clearance is obtained Ifrom Congress survey crews  would be hired to stake out the  area embraced in the proposed  reservoir pool and that contract  drillers would be employed to  make rock studi'es.  The General said if congress  would approve, the army corps  would welcome local participa­tion  in the power phases of the  project authorization by such an  agency as the Pacific Northwest  Power company.  Local sentiment for such parti­cipation  has been strong, part~cu­larly  since the Pacific Northwest  company has met with stumbling  blocks in its efforts to get a li­cense  on a Snake river project.  Use of non-federal funds would  create a valuable local tax base.  The general told the group  that he has read carefully all of  the state and federal reports on  the possible or probable impact  of Bruce's Eddy on wildlife and  fish resources of the Clearwater,  and on the basis of these studies,  is convinced that diehard opposi­tion  to the project from these  sources is either not interested  in their objective findings, or  desires to remain ignorant.  Since the Clearwater contri­buted  16% of the waters of the  1948 flood, "without a single drop  of storage space, this project has  the most flood control potential,  in addition to fabulous power  benefits, both at the site and  downstream, the chief of the  army corps said.

Page 1									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														16 Lewiston (Ida.) MornIng Tribune Thurs., Oct. 20, 1960  670-Feet High  Symbol said not all the engineer­ing  plans have been completed, but  it now appears a 670-foot high dam  can be built at an elevation of 1,600  feet above sea level.  Construction costs for three g;en­erators  to supply 250,000 kilowatt  of power are estimated at $166-mil­lion,  he reported. Final construc­tion  costs ar estimated at $185,000  when another three cJenerators  would be installed to produce a to- .  tal of 510.000 kilowatts.  Six gates to control floods would  provide a flow of 200,000 cubic feet  of water per second, "twice the  maximum flow of record of the  1933 flood." said Symbol.  The dam would store 3.340,000  acre-feet of water, with two million  acre feet utilized for flood control,  he said. (An acre-foot is an acre  of water one foot deep.)  He said the proposed ] 50-foot  drawdown "might disturb some  people. But the water level would  be dropped 150 feet in the winter.  We would hold to the normal level  during the entire summer recrea­tion  season." The water level would  be lowered in the winter to prepare  f spring flood water, he explain­ed.  The pool created by the dam  'ould extend 53 miles upstream.on  th river, e\'en to about eight or  nine miles up the Little North Fork  of the Clearwater, said Symbol.  Symbol said, in passing, that 4  per cent of the big game winter  range would be inundated by the  pool, but did not elaborate. The  dam has long been opposed by wild­life  groups who contend it would  destroy a large portion of the win­ter  range of the area, particularly  for elk.  He said log passage facilities  planned at the dam will reduce  transportation costs and the pool  will provide log storage space. "It  now appears construction of log  handling facilities would be a fed­eral  cost. Maintenance costs would  be borne by private concerns," he  aid.  Symbol anticipated five or six  years will be required for construc­tion  of the dam. The first year of  construction, the 100 employed,  plus about 10 from the Walla Walla  district Corps, would bring about  315 persons to the Orofino area, he  saId.  ruces Eddy ould Be I rled  In 1962, orp ffi lal y  OROFINO - If the next session of Congress provides authorization  and funds construction of a 670-foot high concrete gravity type dam  at Bruces'Eddy could begin in th~ s~ring of 1962, ~ol. ~au.l H. SY!TIbol  told a gathering here Wednesday mght. Symbol IS Istrict en.g1Oeer  for the Walla Walla division of the U.S. Army. Corps ~f Engmeers.  If constructed, it would be the largest dam of Its type 10 the world,  he said. J;--  The Corps of Engineers earlier  had hoped to build a thin concrete  arch dam at the site on the North  Fork of the Clearwater River  "which would look beautiful," said  Symbol. But he said geological  problems, particularly on the west  ide of the river, and the fact that  the opposing bluffs slope off too  sharply will prevent this type of  construction.  Symbol spoke to 250 packed into  the Veterans of Foreign Wars Hall.  The meeting was sponsored by the  Clearwater Dam Ass'n.  Predicts Favoring Action  Mayor A. B. (Bert&gt; Curtis, who  introduced Symbol, predicted favor­able  action on the project in the  next session of Congress. The dam  was first proposed eight years  ago.  The dam has not been athorized  bv Congress but the last session  appropriated $600,000 in planning  funds. Symbol's report was on the  progress of planning by the corp~.  He said one phase in the use of  these planning funds may lead to  better solutions to passage of down­stream  migrant fish through dam  turbines.  Although other dams built by the  corps in the Columbia River Basin  have been lower, "we have had no  trouble getting fish upstream" on  these. he said. The major problem  always has been safe passage of  the d'O\~ nstream fish.  Looking forward to Bruces Eddy,  an experiment was conducted at  Tacoma City Light Co.'s 470-foot  high Cushman Dam No. 2 on the  Olympic Peninsula, said Symbol.  In that experiment, 77.7 per cent  of the 40,000 tattooed Chinook. sal­mon  steelhead and trout urvived  pass~ge through the dam' turb­mes,  he reported. He s.aid pat~ol­ogists  from the U. S. FISh & WIld­life  Service cooperated in the ex­periment  during which turbines  were operating at maximum effi­ciency.  "Cushman is an old dam-not  designed to handle fish," Symbol  noted. .  He said the corps previously had  been working with Allis-Chalmers,  builders of heavy equipment, on  the problem. With information  gained in the tests "we now hope to  de ign new turbines which will in­crease  survival" of the fish passing  throu h them he said.  . 2,200 New People  "During the fourth and fifth years,  when construction reaches its peak,  about 700, plus 60 government em­ployes,  will be on the job. This  would mean a total increase of 2.200  persons moving into the area," he  said.  He added that it is not the present  policy of the Corps of Engineers to  provide housing for construction  workers, unless the situation be­comes  critical. "We look to the peo­ple  of this general area to furnish  this." he said.  While, relocation problems aren't  great at the proposed dam, about  15 miles of road from Ahsahka to  Dent will have to be relocated, he  reported. A bridge or ferry would  have to be used to cross the upper  end of the pool where the road to  Hea'dquarters now crosses the river,  he added. "We will replace all  present roads and preserve facili­ties,"  he said. "Our plan is to leave  ;you people whole. And we will con-ult  with you to find the best solu­tions  to thel'e and other problems."  Oliver Lewis of Walla Walla,  chief of construction for the Walla  Walla division o£ the corps before  his retirement l1h years ago, also  advocated construction of Bruces  Eddy.  "There are no unsolved problems  in connection with Bruces. Edd~,"  \  he said. "Major controversIes. eXIst  in connection with constructlO.n of  dams on the middle Snake RIver.  Dams on the middle Snake should  not be built until these controver-sies  are resolved."

No Road Work  The Corps of engineers still  feels that bypass road work  should be deferred until spring  in event of severe winter wea­ther.  Colonel Beddow will be  featured speaker at a ladies  night dinner here Dec. 3 with at­tendance  limited to a few out-of­town  guests as space will permit,  following advance sale of tickets  to chamber members. Seating is  planned for 150 persons.  Nominating committee report  made by C. O. Portfors named  Samuel F.

Nominations may  be made from the floor prior to  the election on December 3.  General Telephone dis t ric t  manager James Boekenoogen in­troduced  three other company  officials, Robert Williams, Geo.  White and Barney Hill who pro­mised  widely improved toll ser­vice  with creation of a new toll  center at Moscow and advent of  direct distance dialing on Dec.  15. The Moscow toll center will  be discontinued but 8 lines will  be retained for local service to  Lewiston.  Orofino lines to Moscow will  jump from five to 14 with 14  operators there to handle Lewis­ton,  Palouse Empire, Clearwater  and Camas Prairie business.

Bert Curtis  Cl.earwatex -Tr~b. lO/~8/  An Eye Out . .2  ABOUND OBOJrlNO  The story of Bruce's Eddy dam  is one of an impressive achieve­ment  for a small community,  fighting against prejudice and  uninformed opposition over a  long period of years.  It is a story of solid support by  local wildlife groups, foresters,  Clearwater Dams association and  the Orofino Chamber of Com­merce.  It is a story of defeat for  those who fought the dam, in­cluding  some Lewiston sports  spokemen who taxed the creduli­ty  of those willing to listen, par­ticularly  fantasies of damage to  the Idaho elk herd.  Whether or not the dam will  bring all the benefits that local  sponsors have hoped for remains  to be seen. Its construction does  come at a time when logging is  depressed and unemployment is  severe, so its benefits should be  substantial to local economy. -*-. S pee i a I co~endation for  years of impressive work to at­tain  this goal is not always ealSY  to apportion, but in this case  Bert Curtis and Ray McNichols  have done an amazing job of ap­plying  know-how, persuasion and  facts, to enlist ever-growing sup­port.  Bert Curtis said in Washing­ton  he seemed to be walking in  the shadow of the late Senator  Dworshak as the senate gave I  full recognition to his years of  effort and Ray McNichols has  worked tirelessly over the years  to cultivate political friendships  that brought Democratic mem­bers  of the Idaho delegation into  the picture.  With the construction work  moving nearer to reality, it is  time now for an appraisal of the  county and city needs to cope  with the impact of new people  and a big new construction camp.  It would seem that joint action  would be profitable to develop  some of the community DeedsI that are sure to be felt in Ah-sahka,  Riverside and Orofino  areas. 			2011-04-05	2011-04-05	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/892	892	893.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/893.pdfpage

Could Start Next Year, Beddow  (See dams story on page 1)  Construction workers will be ready to move in next summer if  Congress gives the final signal now for building of Bruces Eddy  dam on the North Fork of the Clearwater River.  That was the report last night from Col. James H. Beddow, chief  of the Walla Walla district of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  which for three years has been laying plans for the massive con­crete  structure. ~------------  Colonel Beddow told the Lew­iston  Morning Tribune by tele­phone  from Walla Walla that the  stage is set for construction if­as  is expected-Congress today  passes an initial $2-million ap­propriation  for building of the  dam.  Approval by the House of Rep­resentatives  last night virtually  assured authorization of the dam,  and the appropriation is expected II  to follow.  The dam has been receiving  . design and planning appropria-i  tions since 1959, with the result  that pre-construction design work  has been virtually completed. Nor­mally  this preliminary work de­lays  construction for several  years after authorization of a  dam.  Build Roads, Tunnel  If the appropriation g 0 e s  through, said Colonel Beddow, I  construction of access roads and  a diversion tunnel would begin  next summer. Preliminary plans  call for construction of an access  road along the west bank of the  stream from its mouth to the  dam site, about two miles up­stream.  Another road would be  built to move traffic around  the work area.  The diversion tunnel will chan­nel  the river flow through cliffs  on the east shore, enabling work­men  to build cofferdams across  the river and pump out the pooled  water so excavation can be un­dertaken  for the foundations of  the dam.  Some of the excavation may be  begun next summer, said Colonel  Beddow, but the wall of the dam  probably won't begin to rise for  about two years.  If congressional appropriations I  are made in orderly fashion, con­struction  of the dam would take  about seven years, Colonel Bed­dow  said. The dam will risel some 673 feet from the river  floor making it the fourth highest  dam in the United States, ex-,  ceeded only by Oroville dam I  (730 feet) now under construc­tion  on the Feather River in  California; Hoover Dam (726 feet)  on the Colorado River between  Arizona and Nevada; and Glen  Canyon Dam (710 feet) on the  Colorado River in Arizona.  Bruces Eddy would have six hy­droelectric  power generators with  a total capacity of 690,000 kil­owatts.  It would store 3,453,000  acre-feet of water in a reservoir  extending 53 miles up the river.  Timber In Pool Area  George H. Rauch of Lewiston,  vice president of Potlatch For­ests,  Inc., for lands and logging,  estimated that the thickly forest­ed,  16,970-acre valley to be in­undated  by the reservoir con­tains  about 100-million board feet  of timber, including virtually all  species which are to be found in  north central Idaho.  The timber would be harvested  evenly over the six-or seven-year  construction period, Rauch said,  and the volume is not expected  to have a noticeably adverse ef­fect  on the lumber market.  The reservoir land area is  owned primarily by the state of  Idaho and PFI, although the fed­eral  government has some hold­ings.  A number of small private  holdings exist in the area from  the dam site to about 12 miles  upstream. 			2011-04-05	2011-04-05	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/894	894	895.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/895.pdfpage

Ray McNichols, Orofino attor­ney,  said residents of the Clear­water  valley are elated by news  of final success in the long cam­paign  for federal approval of the  $186-million structure on the North  Fork of the Clearwater River two  miles upstream from Ahsahka.  Sharing McNichols' jUbilation  was Mayor A. B. Curtis of Oro­fino,  who was en route home by  car Friday night from Boise,  where he attended a meeting of  the Idaho Municipal League.  'Most Important'  Curtis, one of Bruces Eddy's  earliest backers, has long describ­ed  the dam as "one of the most  important multi-purpose projects  of the nation."  McNichols praised Sen. Frank  Church and Rep. Gracie Pfost,  IIdaho Democrats, for their role in  leading the authorization battle  I against determined opposition in  the House of Representatives.  "We are all deeply indebted to  )Senator Church and to Congress­j  woman Gracie Pfost for remaining  in Washington and steadfastly in­sisting  in the Congress on the  approval of the Bruces Eddy proj­ect,"  he said.  : McNichols, a Democrat, is co­chairman  of a citizens committee  seeking Church's re-election Nov.  6. Mrs. Pfost is a candidate for  the remaining four years of the  term of the late Sen. Henry Dwor­shak,  a pioneer Bruces Eddy sup­porter,  and is opposed by Sen.  ,Len Jordan, R-Idaho, who re­ceived  an interim appointment to  succeed Senator Dworshak.  Recalls General's View  "Bruces Eddy dam will contrib­ute  flood control, water storage  and low cost power," said Mc­Nichols.  "I am reminded that Gen.  E. C. Itschner, while he was chief  of the U.S. Army Corps of Engi.  neers, described this dam as the  No. 1 project for the West.  "Few people realize that Bruces  Eddy will open up vast new areas  of state, federal and privately­I  owned timber lands now located in Iareas uneconomical for harvesting  because of distance from the  market.  "Construction of the Bruces  Eddy project will be a shot in the  arm to the Clearwater valley econ­omy.  Senator Church reports we  can expect eight years of new  payroll and that this will carry  us over into a time when a new  tourist industry will be established  to support the local economy." 			2011-04-05	2011-04-05	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/896	896	897.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/897.pdfpage

Curtis said that Senator Ro­bert  Kerr of Oklahoma, chair­man  of the conference commit­tee,  kept the promise he made in  Sept. to him and to Ray McNich­ols,  that "There would be an om­nibus  bill and that Bruce's Eddy  would be in it."  The Orofino mayor continued:  "Regional utility companies op­erating  in Idaho, were extremely  cooperative last Thursday in ex­pressing  their wishes to eastern  . and southern power firms, stress­ing  they had no objection to the  inclusion of Bruce's Eddy in the  bill. This assistance may have  helped to swing votes of congress­men  who opposed public power." I  Curtis said Orofino's success in  gaining the project was a tri­bute  to bipartisan cooperation  and the unified support of our  people. Only major opposition  came from the wildlifers who  failed to prove their case after  nine years of questionable and  exaggerated claims. I  In his demands for reduced  wildlife opposition against the I  Bruce's Eddy dam. Sen a tor  Church, in a statement Thursday,  said:  "I have championed the cause  of the conservationists when I  thought they were right," said  Church. "I was floor manager of  the wilderness bill in the Sen­ate  last year because I believed  in it. But I will oppose these  groups with the same vigor when  I think they are wrong.  Bruce's Eddy is needed for pow­er  and flood control. Its benefits  far outweigh its drawbacks. We  must have addeq storage up­stream,  and the· alternative high  dam sites which are left to be  developed in Idaho, like Penny  Chffs on the Middle Fork of the  Clearwater and the sites on the  Salmon River, would do irrep-  . arable injury to both our fish  runs and our wildlife. It iii worse  than shortsighted to P'P 0 s e  Bruces Eddy which will do the  least damage to these resources  while conferring the most bene­fits  in terms of the added stor­age  which we must have."  October 18, 1962  Joint Efforts  Saved Dam'ln  Final Sessio  ~  1  House Yiel s  To ,End Long  Project Fi ht  First Federal upstream flood  control storage project for the  Columbia River basin in nearly  15 years was authorized by con­gress  Saturday when it approved  a $123 million dollar project at  Bruce's Eddy.  House of Representative mem­bers  of the conference commit­tee  forced the senate to back  down on a half dozen other pub­lic  works totaling over $1.3 bil­lions,  but yielded on Bruce's  Eddy and the Asotin project a­bove  Lewiston.  The five billion appropriation  bill for public works that also  passed Saturdjay inc1luded two  million dollars in funds to start  the construction program next  spring.  Lost in the conference commit­tee  during the final day's hassle  I were the China Garden and  Burns Creek projects which had  extensive opposition from private  utility companies as unnecessary  outlay of federal funds.  Bruce's Eddy will give Clear­water  county the highest dam in  the Northwest, 673 feet, and will  take seven years to complete if  congress appropriates money in  an orderly fashion, said Colonel  James H. Beddow, chief of the  Corps of Engineers at Walla  Walla. The concrete gravity arch  structure will be fourth highest  in the ciJuntry. Higher are Oro­ville,  Calif., 730 feet; Hoover  dam, 726 feet; and Glen Canyon,  710 feet.  Apparently power phases of  the dam were not covered in the  authorization since the ultimate  cost of the dam and six.genera­tors  has been estimated by the  Army at. $186,000,000 or $63 mil-  THE CLEARWATER TRIBUNE  lion more than the approved fi­gure.  The dam will store 3,453,~0  feet of water, make a reserVOIr  over 50 miles long flooding out  the mouth of the Little North  Fork with nearly 100 feet of  water.  On motion of George Hutchin­son  chamber of commerce mem­bers  gave a standing ovation  Monday night to Bert Curtis and  Ray McNichols for their Hercu­lean  service over the years in  furthering the achievement of  Bruce's Eddy dam. Hutch said,  "These two went back to Wash­ington  like school boys with their  lunch pails but they carne back  covered with accomplishment and  achievement unparalleled in the  history of Northwest develop­ment."  George Rauch said that a 16,­970  acre pool would yield about  100 million board feet of timber,  not enough to have an adverse  effect on the lumber market.  Most of the area is state land or  owned by PFI.  Colonel Beddow said that ini-'  tial money will be used to build  a road around the project to  serve the Elk River-Dent areas,  and then a tunnel will be con­structed  on the east bank of the  river 0 divert water aroun,d the  coffer dam, right at Bruce's Ed­dy.  Eventually the road to Elk Ri­ver  will be located above 1600­foot  elevation and will skirt the  backwaters of the pool several  miles up Elk Creek canyon, be-fore  rejoining the p~es~nt roadl  to Elk river. It will cross Elk  creek at the mouth of Meadow  creek with a high bridge.  The project calls for a major  1200 foot bridge 4 miles below  the Benton creek bridge at  Grandad creek, connecting up  major CTPA and PTPA area  road systems. The pool will have  183 miles of shore line, all but  40 miles of which will be on pri-vate  lands.

Page 1									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														4 LewIston (Ida.) Morning TrIbune Fri., Nov. 22, 1963  The House Acts On Dworshak Dam  A recent flurry of loose conversa'tion  about the status of Dworshak dam on the  North Fork of the Clearwater River was  rudely interrupted Tuesday by the U.S.  House of Representatives.  A $4,276,116,400 public works approp­riations  ill zipped through the House  and went to the Senate. -The bill included  a $6-million appropriation for the next  stage of construction on Dworshak dam  -':the full amount sought for the next fis­cal  year by the U.S. Army Corps of Engi­neers.  Last-ditch opposition to the dam, par­ticularly  among some organized wildlife  interests, has revived recently in the  wake of several public statements about  the project by the president of Potlatch  Forests, Inc., Benton R. Cancell.  Some of the long-term opponents of  the project apparently were not listening  very carefully to what Cancell said. That,  perhaps, is a separate topic. They should  have been listening enough, however, to  realize what he did not say. He clearly  did not say that PFI is opposing the dam's  construction.  The company obviously is working  hard in behalf of its interests which will  be affected by the dam. A variety of  legislation has been suggested, some of  which may win approval by Congress  and some of which may not. PFI natural­ly  is pressing for the best agreements it  can make with the Corps of Engineers  under present legislation, carefully exam­ining  log passage facilities proposed by  the Corps and exploring the opportunities  for mill faciliti~ ,in the dam area, for  example. The company looked wistfully  for a time at suggestions that it might  receive federal forest lands instead of  cash compensation to pay for its own  lands inundated by the dam. Such pro­posal~,  however, have been considered  often by Congress - and never adopted.  Despite concentrated efforts to bar­gain  with federal agencies and with Con­gress  for the best terms possible, there  never was any indication that PFI or  other Pacific Northwest lumber interests  would seek to stop construction of the  dam. That is the point which some of  the long-term opponents of the project  seem to have missed.  In Idaho and across the country, foes  of the dam greeted Cancell's statements  with hope and joy. 1£ organized wildlife  interests could join forces with the lum­ber  industry, they suggested, Dworshak  dam mi-ght yet be killed, despite its au­thorization  by Congress and the substan­tial  progress on its construction. Columns  were written. Speeches were dusted off.  One organization even went on record ask­ing  Reps. Compton I. White and Ralph  Harding, Idaho Democrats, to "investi­gate"  the familiar charges of damage­to-  wildlife which were investigated and  re-investigated year after year before the  dam was authorized. (How Harding got  into this First District act instead of Sen.  Frank Church and Len B. Jordan was  not clarified.)  Perhaps Cancell did stimulate these  hopes among the dam's opponents by  some of his statements. He recalled, for  ex~mple, that his company years ago  adopted a policy of "neutrality" toward  the project - although he was not ex­actly  sure why.  In this connection, it is perhaps pertin­ent  to recall that the dam first was pro­posed  as a private power project. Pacific  Northwest Power Co. applied to build the  dam under a "partnership" arrangement.  The brilliant and persuasive chairman of  the Pacific Northwest board of directors,  Kinsey M. Robinson, devoted his remark­able  talents to lining up support for the  project - or at least trying to neutralize  any opposition. Somewhat ironically, the  considerable success of his effort became  a major asset of the Corps of Engineers  when the "partnership" approach was  abandoned and the project was desig­nated  for federal sponsorship.  At any rate, the unlikely alliance be­tween  wildlife organizations and the for­est  products industry, which some foes  of the dam hopefully anticipated, has not  developed. At least, it has not developed  to any extent discernible thus far in that  remarkably sensitive barometer of politi-,  cal pressures, the House of Representa-tives.  I  Like most major river development  projects, Dworshak dam has always had  most of its opposition in the House. The  Senate voted repeatedly to authorize the  dam before House concurrence could be  obtained. 1£ there were any major inclin­ation  in Congress for a reversal of posi­tion,  it would be detected first in the  House, not the Senate.  The big appropriations for Dworshak  dam are yet to come in future sessions  of Congress, of course. Certainly there  will be hard bargaining over conditions  and specifications in connection with  these appropriations. But the House has  demonstrated pretty decisively that  Dworshak dam is going to be built. The  remaining battles will be over details ­including  some very important and inter- 1  esting details, to be sur , but still de­tails.  - B.

Page 1									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														LEWISTON, Idaho - Potlatch  Forests, Inc., and the Army  Corps of Engineers aren't at  each other's throats, despite a  federal condemnation suit  brought by the r corps, PFI's  pr1esident said today.  Benton R. Cancell issued a  statement explaining the com­pany's  position regarding a suit  filed· in Federal Court at Boise  Monday, seeking title to 1,070  acres of land owned by PFI,  Clearwater County and 12 other  corporations and individuals in  the neighborhood of the Dwor­shak  dam site on the Clearwa·  ter River's North Fork.  The condemnation involves ap­proximately  10 per cent of the  total PFI land to be acquired  for the Dworshak project, the  remaining 9,000 acres being  within the reservoir area which  will be inundated by the waters  behind the dam.  "The fact that the U.S. Gov­ernment  went to court to take  title to these 1,070 acres of land  does not mean that we are not  getting along with the Corps of  Engineers, in spite of the fact  that the economic problems the  dam will create for our company  are most serious," Cancell said.  Cancell gave timing as the  reason for putting the matter  into the courts. "We are con·  fronted with substantially added  costs which result in a greatly  lessened value of our remaining  properties due to this project,"  he said, "yet neither we nor the  Corps have had time to de­termine  the amount nor the ac­tual  extent of these damages.  The initial lands, however, are  required immediately by the  Corps in order to meet its con­struction  schedule.  "We are in somewhat of a  dilemma, because our lawyers  tell us that we cannot preserve  our claim against the U.S. for  these losses if we voluntarily de­liver  our deeds to the lands now  being condemned.  "We cannot take any chances  U•I  of foregoing our right to be  compensated for the losses we  will sustain by the project.  "We have no ;alternath:e,  but to preserve our eventu·  al rights by being taken to  court. The project schedule  does not allow us time to  make the necessary studies  regarding the over·all value  recompense we will require  if we are to keep our Clear·  water operations intact.  "We would like, of course, to  make one over-all agreement  with the U.S. with respect to  all items of compensation, but  we can't do that this early. e  hope we will have most of the  information in 12 to 18 months.

Page 1									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														4 lewiston (Ida.) Morning Tribune Sat., Oct. 13, 1962  ruces Eddy: The Futur owls ere  passed the House, which has become the  burying ground of many a worthy rivers  development project because of the sen­sitivity  of many House members to the  plaints of the lobbyists. With strong sup­port  from the Kennedy administration  and the Senate leadership, the project  sailed easily through the Senate in a big  omnibus bill which quickly was de­nounced  in the House by foes of public  power projects, spokesmen for the coal  industry, wildlife organization leaders  and assorted other lobbyists. The struggle  was intricate and bitter. Finally, wit h  Church standing by in the Senate ready  to launch a filibuster to save Bruces Ed­dy,  House conferees conceded yesterday  on this one project alone, and Senate con­ferees  accepted the elimination of all  the others opposed by the House.  The expected appropriation today of  $2-million to start construction of Bruces  Eddy will provide a much-needed stimu­lus  for the economy of this region. The  slump in the lumber industry in Clear­water  County and its neighboring coun­ties  is serious indeed. Depression condi­tions  prevail in many areas. The start of  construction on Bruces Eddy will give  this region a major economic shot in the  arm.  However, the effects will not be felt  tomorrow or next week. Delays will be  inevitable in getting started on such  early-stage work as building access  roads and logging of the vast pool area  to provide a clear-cut reservoir site.  Meanwhile, Clearwater County particu­larly  and its neighbors to a lesser degree  will begin to grapple with the problems  of a rapid population influx and some  major changes in economic and social  patterns.  These changes will call for careful,  calm, clear-headed planning. Communi­ty  leaders in Orofino, especially, who  long have worked for the Bruces Eddy  project, have ample understanding of  the vast changes which now lie ahead.  The residents of that community and sur­rounding  ones should make a deliberate  effort - and quickly - to begin fitting  themselves for the new roles they must  fill if teamwork is to avoid chaos in the  transitional years ahead.  During the eight years which- will be  required to construct Bruces Eddy, (as­suming  Congress provides money regu­larly  to keep the project on schedule),  great changes will be occurring through­out  this region. The creation of the larg­est  lake in north central Idaho, for ex­ample,  will revolutionize recreational  activities.  The Lewiston-Clarkston area will have  an opportunity to learn much from Clear­water  County's experiences. The steady  construction of Lower Snake River dams,  which will put Lewiston behind dikes be­fore  1970, will create tremendous changes  in the life of this community, too. Com­munity  planning, only recently re-empha­sized,  will be the key to orderly progress  all along the Clearwater River during  this era of change. Clearwater County  will be leading as it is learning. The good  neighbors throughout the region will have  to develop the skills of neighborliness to  an even higher degree.  But these are welcome challenges.  The authorization of this great dam,  which will alter the pattern of life in this  region, represents a tremendous triumph  for the region and for all of Idaho. The  people of the area have been well repre­sented,  locally and in the Congress, in  this campaign 'for Bruces Ed.dy dam. 11  is an occasion for gratitude and rejoic·  ing - but with remembrance that the  challenge of the future now lies just  ahead. - B. J.  Idaho generally and north central Ida­ho  particularly took a great leap forward  yesterday when Congress authorized (ex­cept  for final formalities today) Bruces  Eddy dam on the North Fork of the  Clearwater River.  It was a remarkable victory for Sen.  Frank Church and Rep. Gracie Pfost  particularly, because this project was the  only one salvaged by the Senate from a  considerable list of major river develop­ment  projects rejected by the House of  Representatives.  For this region, the authorization of  Bruces Eddy (along with Asotin dam on  the Snake River six miles south of Lew­iston  and two southern Idaho projects)  has immediate and long-range implica­tions  of major importance.  When the House finally adopted last  night the report of Senate and House  conferees who had been negotiating all  day to try to salvage some kind of omni­bus  bill, the authorization of B~uces Ed­dy  was assured. The Senate stIll has to  act upon the bill, and President Kennedy  still must sign it, but these are mere de­tails.  Still awaiting approval in both  branches of Congress is a separate ap­propriations  bill which will provide $2­million  to start construction of Bruces  Eddy promptly. The odds now are over­whelming  that this bill will be zipped  through quickly today as Congress has­tens  to dispose of this last major legisla­tion  delaying adjournment.  The authorization of Bruces Eddy will  have an immediate impact because pre­liminary  planning work already has been  completed and the project is ready for  the construction stage. The late Sen. Hen­ry  Dworshak, R-Idaho, created a preced­ent  in Congress when he obtained sub­stantial  and numerous appropriations to  plan Bruces Eddy before it was author­ized.  The argument for this unusual pro­cedure  was a good one. Wildlife interests  which opposed the dam, claiming that it  would damage steelhead fishing and "de­stroy  the Clearwater elk herd," pleaded  for time to conduct detailed studies of  the effects of the project upon wildlife.  Dworshak and other supporters of the  project agreed to this approach. They  argued in turn that engineering studies  also should be proceeding simultaneously  so that Congress could consider all the  facts in one package when the time came  to propose authorization. Congress ac­cepted  the logic of this argument and  appropriated planning money, as well as  wildlife research money, in advance of  authorization.  The studies were made on both fronts.  The engineering studies confirmed  that Bruces Eddy was magnificent  damsite and one of h fe arge stor ge  sites remaining in the United States  which could be developed economically  to provide maximum, multi-purpose use  of the region's floodwaters.  The wildlife study reports generally  purported to show just about what the  objectors had claimed they would show  -but most laymen were not convinced.  The wildlife interests failed to document  their extreme claims of potential elk  damage-but still declined to withdraw  them. They made a substantial case for  their claims of damage to steelhead­but  generally refused to concede that  Bruces Eddy planners were working ear­nestly  and well to minimize and compen­sate  for such losses. At the wildlife lead­ership  level, at least, resistance contin­ued  and the hoped-for conlpromises never  developed. So the advocates of Bruces  Eddy finally decided to make their bid  for authorization.  It was a most interesting struggle.  Sponsors of the project deliberately by- 			2011-04-05	2011-04-05	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/906	906	907.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/907.pdfpage

"I would divide responsibility  equally between Church and Mrs.  Pfost," Brigham said. "Jordan  was in favor of the dam, and he  put pressure to try and get it in  1953, when he was governor, but  he had no important influence  this time because he was not on  the important committees."  Jordan and Mrs. Pfost oppose  each other for the remaining  four-year term of Senator Dwor­shak's  seat, to be decided in the  Nov. 6 general election.  Brigham said studies by the  U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and  the Idaho Fish & Game Depart­ment  bear out his warning that  the dam would pose a serious  threat to fish and wildlife in the  North Fork drainage.  He said the North Fork steel­head  run would never survive  passage over the 600-foot high  LAWNS BUILT  Garden Square  Nursery  415 N. 22nd SH 3-1116  Congress Has ignea eath Warran~t  For North Fork Wildlife, Brigham Says  dam or loss of habitat brought  about by his belief there would  be up to a 155-foot fluctuation in  the reservoir level, which he said  would leave a muc.ibank for 20  miles upstream from the dam.  "The Idaho delegation, includ­ing  Senator Church and Mrs.  Pfost, ignored these studies,"  Brigham said, "and they nearly  completely ignored alternate sites  which would be much less de­structive."  As examples of acceptable al­ternate  projects he cited Pleasant  Valley and Mountain Sheep dams  on the middle Snake River, Para­dise,  Libby and Enaville dams in  Montana and upper Columbia  River dams in Canada.  Congress has signed a death  warrant for unnumbered steel­head,  elk and white tail deer in  the North Fork drainage of the  Clearwater River by giving a go­ahead  for construction of Bruces  Eddy dam, a long-time foe of  the project declared last night.  "The steelhead run up the North  Fork will be wiped out," said  Morton Brigham of Lewiston, pro­gram  chairman of the Lewis­Clark  Wildlife Club.  I'fotal Disaster'  "This means almost total dis­aster  for the white tail deer and  undetermined but heavy damage  to one of the finest elk herds in  the United States," he said.  Brigham commented on con­gressional  action which virtually  assured authorization of the dam,  climaxing a long campaign by  those who seek to harness the  river for flood control and hydro­electric  power production.  Brigham's reaction was at var­iance  with that of the club presi­dent,  Leonard Baldeck of Lew­iston,  who said he was "glad to  see a decision one way or the  other to get the matter settled."  "This will stop a lot of hag­gling  in our area," Baldeck said.  He said he is not personally op­posed  to construction of the dam,  although the club repeatedly has  taken a position against it.  Brigham placed most of the  blame for the success of the au­thorization  struggle on Sen. Frank  Church and Rep. Gracie Pfost,  Idaho Democrats. Mrs. Pfost,  now a candidate for the Senate,  was instrumental in obtaining the  first planning appropriation for  the dam in 1959, he said, and  Church had used all his influence  in the Senate to gain authoriza­tion.  Sen. Len Jordan, R-Idaho, who  took office last August, succeed­ing  the late Sen. Henry Dworshak,  R-Idaho, had negligible influence  in securing authorization of the  dam, Brigham said.

Page 1									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														Lewiston (Ida.) Morning Tribune Fri., Nov. 13, 1964  ed ral rnm nt Enl ring  Land Grab Era, Curtis Says  MOSCOW - The federal gov­ernment  is entering the "era of  the land grab" around Dwor­shak  dam and faces a dilemma  farther north in the Coeur  d'Alene mining district, panel­ists  told the North Idaho Cham­ber  of Commerce and visiting  Idaho legislators Thursday.  A. B. (Bert) Curtis, mayor of  Orofino and a strong force be­hind  construction of the $210  million dam on the North Fork  of the Clearwater River, said  private ownership rights to land  bordering the 53-mile lake the  dam will create are becoming  more in conflict between the  government and theories of  western landowners. He said it  exemplifies a "land grab" pol­icy  of the federal government.  Curtis also announced that the  primary contract for the 673­foot-  high dam, estimated by the  Army Corps of Engineers to be  $123 million, is scheduled to be  awarded in 16 months. He said  the Corps of Engineers has ap­proved  plans for a second bridge  A. B. CURTIS  across the dam reservoir to  "keep Clearwater County from  being divided by the reservoir"  and said tourism is the answer  to avoiding a recession after  the dam is built.  The mining problem reported  to the chamber in a message  from C. E. Schwab, president of  the Bunker Hill Co. at Kellogg,  is in control of silver markets  and production, "the well-being  of this metal depending to a  great extent on what the deci­sion  will finally be as the Treas­ury  Department and the Con­gress  try to solve their dilemma  of consumption (industrial and  monetary) continuing to far out­strip  mine production, and what  changes will be made in our  subsidiary coinage changes."  , Mining Growth Expected  Schwab, in a speech deliver­ed  by Jerry Turnbow, Bunker  Hill industrial relations admin­istrator,  said "as a whole, I be­lieve  the 'look ahead into 1965  will provide a situation for, con­tinued  mining industry growth  and at levels commensurate to  attract the venture capital re­quired  to maintain and improve  these operations."  Schwab was unable at the last  minute to travel to Moscow.  The third panelist at the after­noon  session of the chamber,  Neal M. Rahm of Missoula,  northern region forester for the  U.S. Forest Service, said insects  are causing severe damage in  western forests.  "The tussock moth and the  larch casebearer are widespread  in north Idaho," Rahm said.  "Bark beetle populations are  reaching epidemic proportions  in some areas.  "We may have to move and  move quickly to head off serious  losses within our commercial  forests, in our recreation areas  and on our watersheds.  "Should ins e c t epidemics  cause us to move quickly next  year, I should like to have you  feel reassured that we will not  expose you or your families to  unknown pesticides and untried  hazards. Any work which we do  will have been approved by sci­entists  of national stature."  Work Been Slowed  Rahm said a lack of under­standing  o{ multiple use of for­est  lands "has hampered Forest  Service progress" in gaining  public approval and explained  "we seek combinations of uses  which will offer the greatest  good for the greatest number in  the long run." .  Rahm said special problems  of the Forest Service include  "timber waste within the Can­yon  block on the Clearwater Na­tional  Forest. Here,; some 48  million board feet of timber  are lost to insects and disease  each year. We are building'main  access roads to this area. Soon  timber purchasers will be able  to begin a tremendous salvage  operation. "  Curtis said a joint policy of  the Department of the Army and  Department of Interior has  changed in two years the ac­quisition  policy on minimum dis­tances  that private land can be  developed on the Dworshak dam  pool.  He said this band of land that  will remain out of bounds for  private builders has been in­creased  from a minimum of 100  to 300 feet to 300 feet. Curtis  said the change, which is oppos­ed  by the Western Forestry &  Conservation Ass'n, to which he  belongs, is "not the result of a  change in. the law but of a  change in interpretation."  Halt Deep Freeze-Curtis  Curti" urged the chamber and  visiting Idaho lawmakers to  work to put an end to placing  private lands "into the public  deep freeze." He said 1.5-million  acres of western land goes into  this freezer each year.  In addition to the bridge to be  built across the pool at Grand­dad  Creek (halfway point on the  reservoir) another span is be­ing  asked at Little. Canyon. He  said this bridge would be 1,980  feet long and would exceed 500  feet in height. . 			2011-04-05	2011-04-05	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/918	918	919.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/919.pdfpage

Page 1									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														./  The Man Behind Dworshak Dam · • •  I  Curtis Eyes ut -re  bills and the homesteaders  paid some in 1905, and the  association was born.  Fohl had his eye on a  young fellow born in Salem,  Ore., as the association be­gan  to grow. That man was  Bert Curtis who received  degrees at Lewiston 0rmal  School and the University  of Idaho. Curtis has been  in land, forestry, water and  resource management work  since 1918.  Fohl retired in 1925 and  Curtis was named chief two  years later.  UNDER CURTIS, the as­sociation's  aircraft fleet has  grown faster and more cap­able.  Three aircraft are  used now by highly skilled  men who know the coun­try,  something about the  weather, fire occurrence,  fire behavior, the terrain  and routes of travel, the  needs of fire crews and fire  science. And nearly 3,000  miles of multipurpose roads  traverse the region.  There are also many  modern lookouts. Starting  with a forest of unsurveyed  trails and unknown wilder­ness,  the association today  looks over about a million  acres of highly productive  forest land.  But this is just one part  of the story about the man  from Orofino.  Rather than sit on his  hands and wait for things  to happen, Curtis helps cre­ate  change if he thinks it  is for the right reason.  For the last 16 years, he  has been the mayor of Oro­fino.  He is past president  of the Idaho Municipal  League and a director for a  decade. has been director and  trustee of the Western Fores­try  and Conservation Asso­ciation  for 12 years, past  president of his section of  the ociety of American  Foresters. chairman of thp  development and advisory  committee of re 'ources for  the Nez Perce Indian tribe.  a m mber of the ('niver­Sity  of Idaho Rese~Il'('h  Council. and ha held other  important posts that would  take pages to detl.lil.  The most recent is hI.'  By Don Walker  EACH BIG project has a  man who, rightly or wrong­ly  is credited as the key  reason for its being.  As the spillway of the  Dworshak Dam begins to  climb against the skyline  near Orofino, Idaho, an un­common  man named Albert  B. Curtis is certain to be  counted among those who  made it all possible. And,  as most prime movers, Cur­tis  assumes many roles in  carrying out what he thinks  is proper.  Bert Curtis come  through as clear and as  crisp as the ring of an axe  echoing through forest can­yons.  He is a tall man whose  stride belies hi 63 years.  Curtis wears gla ses, is soft  spoken, friendly and out­going  and possesses a razor  sharp mind. His secret  weapon is that he gets  things done.  CURTIS IS the chief of  the Clearwater - Potlatch  Timber Protective Associa­tion  which cares for the fire  problems of timber owners  in northern Idaho, an area  which when plotted on a  map looks like an oversize  checkerboard.  The timber it looks after  is a mixture of private and  public ownership. No one  owner is big enough to play  Smokey the Bear in the  area so the association was  formed in 1905. It was  unique then and it is today.  Timber owners are as­sessed  under a simple  plan. The association di­vides  the total cost of pro­tection  by total acres to get  the cost per acre. Each  member then pays his pro­rated  share.  Prior to 1905, there was  no state acti vity in forest  protection, no United States  Forest Service in Idaho, no  one to protect the forests.  This led to th formation  of the Clearwater. Timber  Protective As. O('i~lt ion. Fa­ther  of the idea \\ as Theo­fore  Foh!, a (;~.'rman im­migrant.  Another mikstorw was  paying nwn to fight fires.  The state paid :ome of the  CURTIS today has modern compact aircraft to assist him in his work.  PLANES began to scan Curtis's forest areas in 1920's.  DWORSHAK DAM, now underway, has b~en a treasured dream of Curtis for many years.  8 THE SPOKESMAN..REV.lEW" NOVEMBER 6. 1966 			2011-04-05	2011-04-05	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/975	975	976.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/976.pdfpage

Page 1									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														DAM S DI . CUSSE D- Col. Allen Clarke (right), Portland District engineer for the U.S. Corps  of Army En.glneers,. and Sen. Henry Dworshak (R-Idaho) conferred recently at Washington, D.C., on  Columbia RIver drainage dams. Col. Clarke said the Bruces Eddy site on the North Fork of the  Clearwater River is "supe.rior" for an electric power and flood control dam.  ddy-Dwor hak  Back when Pub-li~her Swisher was wntmg "by the  inch" for the Salt Lake Tribune, the Portneuf River had •  a higher repute than nowadays. In spring, when the  river wQuld flood the homes along its banks, the stories  out of Salt Lak: were almost as long as the stream.  . ow the Portneuf seems to be getting ready for  another romp among the lowland gardens and the  golf course. The problem is real, but it's not big in  comparison to the same problem along the banks of the  Clearwater or Priest River in northern Jdaho.  There has been some talk again in this national  legislature of building a combined flood-control, power  dam-or tw-o dams on the Clearwater.  When they talk about flood control on the Clear­water,  they're not fooling. Bridges, houses, a ball park  and the fairgrounds building went toward Portland in  the last big flood. Orofino creek, a minor feeder of  the Clearwater, is bigger than the Portneuf and in  flood time clashes house-sized boulders into gravel.  The Cleanvater is four husky rivers, the Lochsa,  Selway, South Fork and Torth Fork. At present, the  only appr&lt;Vved darr'tsite is on the North Fork, leaving  three towns and as many bridges at the mercy of the  river on the other two forks.  Public or private, low or high, the Clearwater  needs to be dammed before another year such as 1948  happens. The state of Idaho paid out enough in road  and bridge repairs that summer and in years following  to build a espectable plug somewhere in the Clear~  water.  My reason for writing this is to ask for under­standing  of the problem here in the far south. And,  Orofino creek keeps rooting up the sod in my mother's  back yard.  elps ruee  damage will be minor in compari- head runs blocked bv the dam.  on with benefits to be derived "5.

Dwor­sha~  OCR-Idaho&gt; said Wednesday  that refusal by the Federal Power  Commi sion to authorize construc­tion  of two dams on the Snake  River "points the finger of neces­ity"  at the Bruces Eddy dam  on Idaho's Clearwater River.  "The middle Snake," Dworshak  aid in a statement, "has turnecl  into a power no man's land and  it may be year before the dis­putes  can be settled. Our only hope  for orderly development is to con­struct  other dams while the Snake  fight is being waged."  The Power Commis ion turn d  down an application from Pacific  Northwest Power Co. to build dams  at Mountain Sheep and Pleasant  Valley. Instead the agency sug-gested  construction of a high dam  at the ez Perce site downstream.  Continued development of the  Northwest's water resources "dic­tates  that Bruces Eddy be built in  the near future," Dworshak said  adding that it has fewer factor~  to create construction delays than  any of the proposed Snake River  dam sites.  He said reasons for early con­struction  include the e:  "1. The need for starting con­struction  of more water control  facilities in the orthwest.  "2: Reports by the U. S. Army  Engmeers that Bruces Eddy is a  superior natural damsite.  "3.

MONDAY thru FRIDAY  A' •••  I{-"~  Senate, House Conferees Still  Deadlocked Over Rivers Bill  Conferees from the u.s. Senate and House of Representatives  remained deadlocked over controversial projects in an omnibus  river development bill last night after 2112 hours of debate in a  conference committee, Sen. Frank Church, D-Idaho, reported.  North, Orofino.  House conferees remained ada­mant  in insisting that Bruces Eddy  and Burns Creek dams in Idaho,  among other projects, be stricken  from a Senate-passed authoriza­tion  bill, Church told the Lewis-r  ton Morning Tribune in a tele­phone  interview.  "I personally take the position  that we either get Bruces Eddy  or there will be no bill at all ap­proved  by Congress," Church said.  "I am prepared to do whatever  an individual senator can· do to  force the issue, including a fili­buster  as long as I can hold tm  Senate floor."  Church said House conferee:  went back to the House leader  ship for further instructions aftel  arguing without avail with the  Senate conferees, who held out for  the Senate version of the authori­zation  bill.  Resumption Possible  "It is possible that the confer­ence  will resume tomorrow,"  Church said, "so our vigil here  will have to continue."  Church said it would "require a  . miracle" to win congressional ap­proval  of Burns Creek dam on the  upper Snake River now that the  , House has rejected its authoriza­tion  by a roll-call vote. He said  "we have very serious trouble"  with the Bruces Eddy project, on  the North Fork of the Clearwater  River, "owing to the adamant  position the House conferees thus  far have taken. It is difficult to  predict what the outcome will  be."  He said House conferees were  not bound formally by a rule  adopted by the House membership  yesterday to refuse to concede on  points in disagreement.  "The conferees are not instruct­ed  with respect to specific proj­ects,"  Church said. "However, the  criteria laid down by Rep. How­ard  Smith, D-Va., chairman of the  House Rules Committee, have the  strong support of several of the1  conferees."  Three House conferees had said  Tuesday that they would oppose  any projects added by the Senate  on which House hearings have not  been held, plus any projects added  by the Senate which lack approval  by the Bureau of the Budget. The  stipulation respecting House hear­ings  would involve Columbia Riv­er  Basin projects submitted for  . authorization, but Church indicated  that other arguments were being  aired in the closed-door confer­ence.  House Against Idaho Dams  "The House conferees are voic­ing  strong objections to either  Bruces Eddy or Burns Creek," he  said. "They have listed a serIes  of other projects that they ask 'e  stricken from the bill, includilg  the Knowles dam in Montana.

Morning Tribune Wed., Oct. 10, 1962.  ul tio s u  ruces Eddy Dam  n Poor Position  The House Rules Committee decided yesterday at  Washington, D. C., to send an omnibus water projects  authorization bill to a House-Senate conference - but  with stipulations that jeopardize Bruces Eddy and Burns  Creek dams in Idaho and perhaps other Columbia River  Basin projects.  The Associated Press reported the Rules Committee  decided upon negotiations to reconcile differences be­tween  Senate and House bills only after House Public  Works Committee members pledged that they would not  yield in conference to accept controversial projects  added by the Senate. Rep. Howard W.

The final bucket  of 6.6 i1' . ain ru r of thri17-fuor  high dam near Orofino. The two are working on a portion of the roadway deck atop the dam.  Last Massive Bucket f Concrete  Poured For iant Dworshak Dam  By SYLVIA HARRELL  Tribune Staff Writer  AHSAHKA - A ceremony  Friday marked placement of  the final buckets of mass con­crete  at Dworshak Dam.  The first ceremonial bucket,  tripped by U.S. Rep. Steven D.  Symms, R-Ida., and Col. Rich­ard  M. Connell, Walla Walla  district engineer for the Army  Corps of engineers, carried the  figure: 6,626,645 cubic yards.  The three ceremonial buck­etloads,  each of about eight  cubic yards, went into the re­maining  portion of the con­crete  deck atop the dam.  The second bucket was  tripped by Ronald Maxwell,  g e n era I superintendent for  Dworshak Dam Constructors,  and Ben W. Molle, Dworshak  res ide n t engineer for the  corps.  The third bucket, tripped by  Orofino Mayor A. B. Curtis  and Clearwater County Com­missioner  Bill Bird of Greer,  splashed wet concrete on Colo­nel  Connell and some of the  other dignitaries standing by.  Although the ceremony mar­ked  the last of the massive  concrete placement, concrete  work will continue at the dam  for some time.  The remaining 4,000 cubic  yards to be placed between  now and June 1 will be archi­tectural  c ncrete, explained  Maxwell.  It will be used to complete  the north and south elevator  towers, the parapets or low  walls along the .op and other  small finishing touches.  How much is 6.6 million cub­ic  yards?  Enough concrete to build the  second highest concrete grav­ity  dam in the United States,  717 feet high from bedrock to  top. (The dam is the third  highest of any type in the  United States. Oroville, in Cal­ifornia,  is highest, with Hoover  next).  Enough concrete to build a  base 525 feet wide, tapering to  a crest 30 feet wide and 3,300  feet long with a roadway pro­viding  space for two lanes of  traffic; enough concrete to  surround all of the dam's in­terior  hallways, tunnels, eleva­tor  shafts, gates, piping and  o the r paraphernalia which  make a dam more a series of  holes surrounded by concrete  than a massive block.  And finally, enough concrete  to hold back the North Fork of  the Clearwater River for 53  winding miles and to store 3.5  million acre feet of water. (An  acre foot is enough water to  cover an acre with water one  foot deep).  In all, it took four years and  nearly nine months to com­plete  concrete work to this  point.  The first dribbles were  placed April 30 and May 1,  1968, to patch holes in the  north and south canyon walls,  but the first bucket used to  build the dam itself was  placed June 22, 1968.  Now the work is steadily  winding down.  Dworshak Dam Construe-tors,  which in 1970 had a pay­roll  peak of about 1,700 em­ployed  on three shifts, now  employs about 250 on one shift.  About 100 more are employed  by subcontractors on dam and  powerhouse work and the  corps resident engineer's staff  has dwindled to 40.  The afternoon ceremony  drew most of the top corps of­ficials  and their wives from  the Walla Walla district office.  Mindful of enVIronmental­ists'  pressure on the corps to  build no more dams, one of the  officials quipped, "This is pro­bably  the last 700-foot high  dam we'll build this year, so  we thought we'd better come  and see it getting finished."  As the visitors stood on the  unfinished roadway atop the  dam to watch the ceremony in  35-degree weather, they also  overlooked the lower end of  the blue reservoir, bathed in  sunlight.  All the lower end of the pool  has been cleared of floating  debris; in fact, two-thirds of  the pool has been cleared and  the remainder will be swept  clean by next fall.  Meanwhile, inside the po­werhouse  below the down­stream  face of the dam, other  workmen were checking and  making adjustments on the  first turbine and generator,  soon to produce power.  Gary Willard, chief of eng­ineering  for the corps at Dwor­shak,  said the schedule calls  for what he termed a "mech­anical  run" of the No. 1 gener­ator  the end of next week.  The 90,000 kilowatt-capacity  generator and turbine, linked  by a 36-inch diameter steel  shaft, will be turned slowly to  make sure there are no obst­ructions  and everything is in  working order, he explained.  That run will produce no pow­er.  But by Feb. 15, experts in  power production will begin to  synchronize the first Dwor­shak  power output with the al­ternating  current carried on  the Bonneville Power Admin­istration  transmission line and  thus fit Dworshak power into  the entire system.  By March 1, the first gener­ator  should be producing com­mercial  power and by April 1,  the other two generators  should be added to the line.  The No.2 generator also has  a 90,000 kilowatt rated capac­ity,  the No.3, a 220,000 kilo­watt  capacity.  This will give the power­house  the flexibility of produc­ing  90,000 kilowatts with one  generator, 180,000 kilowatts  with the two smaller ones,  220,000 with the large one, 310,­000  kilowatts with a large and  small one and 400,000 kilowatts  with all three generators on  the line.

A 55-year-old Army general step­ped  from the plane, shook hands  with several official greeters and  began setting the pace yesterda.Y  for a whirlwind excursion into north  central Idaho. With him was a par­ty  of five officials of the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers.  Lt. Gen. E. C. Itschner and party  stopped briefly at the Lewiston Air­port  at 10:35 a.m. and with state  police leading the way stepped from  staff cars at the site of the pro­posed  Bruces Eddy Dam on the  North Fork of the Clearwater-51  milE:'s and one hour later.  I The top man of the corps was  briefed along the route by Roy  H u f f man, Lewiston, Idaho vice  president of the Inland Empire  Waterways Assn. and one - day  mayor of Lewiston representing Dr.  D. K. Worden, and Col. Myron  Page Jr., chief of the Walla Walla  district of the corps.  Orofino officials pointed toward  the sheer, solid rock canyon walls  which would support the dam struc­ture.  They drove 10 miles from Oro­fino  upstream to Elk Creek where Ithe reservoir storage area would  begin.  Then it was a hurried trip to  Orofino and lunch and finally a  breather. The party departed Oro­fino  at 2 p.m. and were on a plane  headed for Pasco by 3 p.m.  This was the brisk pace main­tained  by the general. He was on  a tightly-scheduled tour of the  Northwest. He came here from  Wenatchee yesterday morning and  was entertained at Walla Walla  last night after driving to the  Bruces Eddy site and later the Ice  Harbor dam site on the Lower  Snake River.  Party Has To Hurry To Keep  Pace With Engineers' Chief  In the party were Col. Allen  Clark, division engineer of Port­land;  Col. W. T. Leber, corps ex­ecutive  officer from Washington,  D.C., Col. Paul H. Symbol, who  will replace Col. Page Aug. 6 as  chief engineer at Walla Walla;  William Zinc, civilian engineer of  the Walla Walla district; and John  W. Roach, civilian engineer of the  Washington office.  They were met at Lewiston by  Ted Dufour, president of the Lew­iston  Chamber of Commerce, and  Huffman. Harry Hughes, secretary  of the chamber, went with the  group to Orofino and the dam site.  At Orofino were Mayor A. B.  Curtis, Ray Mc ichols, Judge Ben  Bear, president of the Orofino  Chamber of Commerce; William  Bird, Robert Werner, Robert Oud  and Frank Frost.  Chief Since 1956  Gen. Itschner was named chief  of the corps of engineers Oct. I,  1956, after serving as division engi­neer  at Portland from April 1952  to March, 1954. He is a 1923 gradu­ate  of the U. S. Military Academy.  Since March 1954 Gen. Itschner has  had the responsibility for supervi­sion  and investigation, planning,  construction and maintenance of  federal river and harbor flood con­trol  multi-purpose projects.  His tour in this area took him  some 120 miles in about five hours.  He had viewed the dam site previ.  ously as division engineer at Port·  land.  The general will leave this morn­ing  from Walla Walla by plane for  The Dalles, Ore., on his tour of  Northwest projects. On the flight  to The Dalles he plans to view the  Columbia River where extensive re­location  work will be required dur­ing  construction of John Day Dam.  He will later drive to the John Day  site. 			2011-04-05	2011-04-05	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1000	1000	1001.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1001.pdfpage

Rock Work Slated Soon on Big Dworshak Dam - Page 1									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														AHSAHKA - Fog that intrudes   into every convolution of the land at   this time of year gives Dworshak   damsite a look of languorous gray,   with bared hillsides bisected by a   twisting river.   Smoke, ri ing from the burning brush   and trees taken from the stripped slopes,   mingl and is lost in the mist. The   fire are the beginning of a $ 210- million   project which will change the economic   face of northern Idaho.   Dworshak Dam, 1% miles from Ah­sahka   on the North Fork of the Clear­water   River, promises to be the biggest   thing to happen in the Clearwater coun­try.   With the opening of bids Wednesday   at Walla Walla on the $ 4- million diver­sion   tunnel and fi h passage, the dam   will be on its way up. By 1972, the dam is   scheduled to be finished. Its power gen­erators   will harvest the kinetic energy of   free water and control flooding.   Orofino, the nearest incorporated town,   stands to gain population rapidly begin­ning   in 1965. Total employment at the   damsite i expected to hit 680 by the end   of next year. The peak will arrive in   1968, when 1,930 employes will be build­ing   the main part of the 673- foot- high   concrete dam. Mayor A. B. Curtis of   Orofino, who has worked for years to get   the dam authorized by Congress, esti­mate   Orofino will have 12,000- 15,000 peo­ple   during the construction compared with   the present 2,500.   It was a long and often frustrating   campaign to get the dam on the federal   government's construction list. Originally   it was to be Bruces Eddy Dam. The name   came from a point on the North Fork   where the dam will be. Bruce Lipscomb   To Award Contract   A 40- foot diameter diversion tunnel in   the contract to be awarded Wednesday   by the Army Corps of Engineers will be   built around the damsite- the first tangi­ble   construction. About 150 men will be   employed to build the tunnel through the   mountainside to handle the river flow un­til   the dam is completed. Several changes   in the specifications have been made   since the original drawings were com­pleted,   including a change in plans for   protecting migrating fish.   Work so far has been financed by an   $ 8.5- million appropriation for the 1964 fis­cal   year. Part of that went for a detour   road site clearing, and the diversion tun­nel.   Curtis said about $ l1- million will be   needed for the next fiscal year. And in   1967, when the prime contract for the   cofferdam and main dam will be let,   about $ 123- million will be needed.   First phase of brush and tree clearing   is scheduled to be finished by next week   by Hubner & Michner, Inc., Denver. Rock   work on the diversion tunnel probably   will begin soon after the contract is   awarded. Logs coming downriver in the   spring will pass through the diversion   tunnel, Curtis said, on their way to the   main Clearwater River and then to Lew­iston   mills.   The fish passage problem, which in­volves   salmon and steelhead swimming   upriver to spawn was a matter of con­cern   to wildlife experts and sportsmen   alike. In fact, the question of how to get   fish around dams anywhere - Brownlee,   Ice Harbor or Bonneville- has raised more   argument among laymen then anything   else.   The first plan announced by. Army   Engineers was to use a bucket system in   which a cable tramway would lift buckets   vertically to clear the upstream. coffer   dam crest and then 1,200 feet horizontally   to deposit the fish in the river upstream.   This kind of equipment was used at Ice   Harbor Dam.   Now the Corps has come up with   plan5, said Curtis, that call instead for a   catch basin which fish will be induced to   enter. Then they will be lifted to the top   of the dam and put in a 1,000- gallon   truck.

S••Ccinada Treaty  Provisions Explained  Here are the major provisions of thl'!' proposed treaty  between the United States and Canada to provide for de.  velopment ot the upper Columbia river:  1. Construction of three storage projects In canada total­ing  15,500,000 acre feet withIn 10 years with costs to be  borne by Canada. 'These projects would be at the outlet of  Arrow lakes and at Mica Creek on the Columbia and at  the outlet of Duncan lake in the Kootenay river basin.  2. The United States could build its proposed Libby dam  with its reservoir extending on the Kootenai 42 miles into  canada. Canada would make the lands available and pre­pare  Its portion of the reservoir without cost to the United  States. Thls project must be started within five years  after ratification of the treaty, or we lose the option. I3. The United States would pay Canada $64,000,000 for  one-hall the flood control benefits derived on this side of  the border over the 6O-year tile of the treaty.  4. The proposed treaty would prohibit any diversion of  water out of the Columbia river basin. Alter 20 years.  however. Canada could divert 1,500,000 acre feet from  the Kootenay to the Columbia (at Canal Flat) provided  the flow of the Kootenay is not reduced below 200 cubic  feet per second or the natural flow which ever Is the lesser.  5. Power benefits derived downstream in the United  States would be shared SO·50 with Canada.  6. Canada's share of the power would be delivered to  the border near Oliver, B. C., at United States expense.  7. Each country would name an "operating entity" to  carry out the provisions of the treaty.  8. The treaty would be In efleet for a minimum of 60  years from ratification and will continue unless at any  time alter 50 years one country gives the other & IO-year  notice of tenninatlon.

Army Corps of Engineers. 1s to  illustrate the potential hydroelectric beneficial effect~ of the three Canadian Treaty water,storage dams,  Arrow. Mica, and Duncan, upon the series of multipurpose dams on downstream on the Columbia.  Each  _,hydroelectric generator at Bonneville, The Dalles, John Day, and McNary consumes on the average a flow  of 12.000 cubic feet per second under n~l load. To operate one of these approximately 70.00o-kil~~.tt  generators for one hour requires a fl~w of approximately 43.5 million cubic feet or 1.000 acre-feet.  One thousand acre-feet released at onc of the far upstream Canadian dams during one singlc hour would  provide sufficient water tv operate a generator at each of the eleven hydroelectric plants downstream on the  Columbia. Properly coordinated, t't!s 1,000 acre-feet passing through each of the elevon dams downstream on  the Columbia. could provide kilowatts for a half day. equal to the output of another Bonneville.  On the Snake River, completion of Dworshak Dam on the North Fork of the Clearwater, will have a like  effect upon the four dams to be eventually completed downstream on the Lower Snake, In addition to the  Snake River's Lower Granite, Little Goose. Lower Monumental, and lee Harbor dams, the four downstream dams  on the Columbia below its confluence with the Snake, HcNary, John Day, The Dal~es, and Bonneville, will  also benefit.  This complicated upstrea~ storage scheduling of released water is now being studied. so as to result  in a greater hydraulic benefit downstream, with the availability of a greater amount of prime power being  assured. 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1015	1015	1016.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1016.pdfpage

By LEVERETT RICHARDS  ofTM 0rt&gt;g0nlM Ibfl'  It wu 27 years ago, Memorial Day,  1948. that I saw a city die.  At 4:15 p.m., Vanport was • city of  sleepy suburbanites doting In tbe Sun­day  sun. lulled by the lIughter of chi!.  dren at play. By 5:15 p.m., Vanport was  a city of silence, covered by the black  waters of the flooding Columbia River.  Never has • city grown so big so  fast, lived so short a life and died so  suddenly, yet with so little loss of life.  Vanport was born during World  War It to provide housing for some  40,000 workers for Kaiser's shipyards  In Portland and Vancouver, Wash Con­struction  was started with wartime  haste SePL I, 1942. The first shipyard  workers swarmed Into the wooden  apartment bUildings Dec. 12, 1942.  Within a year, V,nport was the sec­ond  biggest city l.n Oregon, the largest  war housing project in U.s. history - a  city ~t wasn't, city, a city without a  mayor. a council, a court of law, a  chamber of commerce, or a single  homeowner, a city without local taxes  or local govemment; n city without a  head, a htart or a soul.  F1ve-and-a-half years after this drab  war baby was born, she was dead. By  that time, her population had dropped  to 17,500. Among modem disasters, the  death toll Is a&gt;nsidered low: 30 the  length of the Columbia. 1510. Vanport.  The Vanport flood followed 30 days  of hot, dry weather throughout the C0­lumbia  Basin of Washington and British  Columbia, sparked by wann rains In the  mountains.  By Memorial Day, Sunday, May 31,  the Columbia River at Vancouver had  ruched 28.3 feet, topping many dikes  and breaching others along the river.  Fears of lowlanders had been lulled  by notices from the Army Corps of  Enclneers, delivered that very day,  assuring residents, wrhe dikes an safe  at present ... Don't let excited ...."  Nevertheless, many had moved out,  wary of the foam-flecked floodwaters  that rose ever higher on the river dikes  protecting the two-story wartime  apartments. Most of the other residents  had gone fishing or sunbathing at the  beach, the mountains or the old swim­ming  hole.  The backwaters of tbe Columbia  and the Willamette rivers seemed to be  sleeping In the sun, lapping only gently  at the SP&S Railway fill that crossed  the swampy bottomland east of Smith  Lake. A work train was chugging along  the fill toward Vancouver, when sud­denly  there was a breach In the flll, 75  to 100 feet wide. The swampy founda·  t10n had given way like toothpaste.  "There was no warning. There was  a 60-foot breach, then 300 feet, then  600," said Calvin Hulbert. seaplane pilot  who was circling overhead at the time.  The sullen waters snaked quietly  through the widening breacb, spread  out througb tbe ditches and marsbes  •  and massed their strength for the  assault on the city.  Dr. Stephen Epler. chief biologist at  Vanport College, founded during the  war In shipyard buildings, was In his  omce involved In paper work when he  look~ up at about 4:15 p.m., just in  time to see the railroad fdl give way. He  rushed to his pickup truek and raced  toward the residential section of tbe  city, like Paul Revere, shouting, "Get  out" the dike has broken! Take to the  dikes!"  A motorcycle policeman also raced  through the streets spreading the alarm.  But nO one heeded. "Why get excited?"  they asked. "Where Is the water?" Sud·  denly, there was water, roiling out of  the marshes like a tidal wave, nUdging  huge buildings aside with bulldozer  blows. Hugh Ackroyd and t had flown  down to Clatskanie l.n a tandem sea­plaAe  to photograpb the broken dikes In  that area. We returned just in time to  see the wall of a two-story apartment  burst like a balloon under the Impact of  the current. SUddenly kitchens, bed­rooms  and parlors were laid bare. Peo­ple  wert scurrying around like actors in  a horror movie.  An old man ran ahead of the racing  waters pulling a wagon with two  screaming tots In iL Tbe water o\'er­took  him.  cah..in Hulbert, seaplane pilot, saw  people running around trying to save  fumlture and clothing, dogs. eats and  children. "I hollered at tbem to run for  their lives, but tbey couldn't hear, of  course," he said. "I got sick to my stom·  ach '\lnd went back to base. It looked  like hundreds of people were being  drowned or crushed as buildings  smashed together."  Ackroyd and I watched two men  paddle desperately In the current, half­submerged  on a section of board walk.  Another man lay on his stomach on a  .m..a.tt.r.ess, paddling hard with both  There was some panic at first ­women  screaming for their children.  men shouting urgent warnings. But,  mostly, Vanport died quietly.  Within an bour, the water was 12  feet deep. All buildings were afloat or  grounded against the dikes. At 5:«  p.m.. a wandering apartment house,  goaded by the dying current, nudged  the flagpole that stood at the entrance  to thl!' silent city. The pole wavered.  hesitated, then went down.  "That's the end of Vanport," some­one  said. And It was.  Rumors of bodies stacked up like  cordwood persisted for weeks, but In  the end only 15 bodies were found. Sev·  en other bodies were never accounted  for. Vanport was a cit)' of transients.  It Is quiet as the grave there now ­except  00 weekeDds when drag races  are held on the asphalt track. No one  has 1I\'ed there since that fatal day in  May, and no one will under present city  plans. 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1018	1018	1019.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1019.pdfpage

Page 2									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														A Key To Area Development  Bruce's Eddy dam and reservoir will be  operated as a key part of the multiple pur­pose  development of the water resources of  the Columbia River basin. It will play a  major role in alleviating the power short­ages  that are recurrently facing its people  and industries.  Proposed operation of the reservoir con­templates  keeping the pool area full during  the summer months for power generation  and to make a beautiful lake fOI' recreation,  summer homes and other aesthetic uses.  Water level would be lowered during the  period of low water from November until  spring to supplement downstream flow and  to provide space to catch flood watel"S which  normally occur in May preventing highway  damage both in the Clearwater, Snake and  Columbia rivers proper.  About II:! million acre feet of storage  is usable for river control purposes.  Inception of the study of the project to  build a dam on the North Fork began short­ly  after the disastrous 1948 flood when it  became evident that although control of the  rampaging Cleanvater river was vital, the  people of the river valley were adamant  that the main channel of the river providing  the only east and west access through north  central Idaho could not be blocked for the  proposed Kooskia dam.  Least Injury To Area  The Bruce's Eddy project is designed to  give the area it serves the maximum bene­fits  with the least amount of disturbance  and injury. Its completion encompasses  road improvements far superior to the  present canyon area much of which is not  now accessible by automobile. 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1027	1027	1028.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1028.pdfpage

Clear­water  River is the greatest contributor to  flood damages. The present favorable op·  portunities for storage to the interest of at­site  and downstream power production as  now proposed would involve no commitment  of water that would be used for irrigation  or other consumptive use. and blockage of  the streams at the feasible dam site would  cause negligible damage to fish runs." 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1028	1028	1029.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1029.pdfpage
Page 4									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														WIDESPREAD BENEFITS  Sound thinking leaders of the Pacific  ! orthwest support the multipurpose Bruce's  Eddy flood control and power project be­cause  it is superior to all other sites in pro­viding  a combination of these essentials:  1. Effective flood control.  2. Dependable at-site power.  3. Impressive down stream power firm­ing  benefits.  4. Immediate access for easy and speedy  construction.  5. Insignificant damage or disruption to  the economy of North Central Idaho or to  travel routes of its people.  6. Impressive benefits in making access­ible  large bodies of private, state and fed­eral  timber now not harvestable.  7. 0 encroachment on lands dedicated  to recreation, big game or wild life use.  8. Opportunity for investment of private  capital as well as federal funds to broaden  the tax base of Clearwater County and the  State of Idaho.  9. Continued interest of utility companies  adequately financed to obtain early start  and completion of the project in time to  meet the region's critical 1960 power needs.  Need Upstream Storage  Upstream storage such as Bruce's Eddy  is vital to the success of the lower Snake  River navigation development for which  the Inland Waterways Association has  worked so diligently during the past twenty  years.  Free enterprise capital from investors all  over America is available to share in the  potential development of the Northwest.  It must be permitted to help in those pro­jects  which require funds far beyond the  capacity of appropriations by Congress. 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1029	1029	1030.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1030.pdfpage

Page 6									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														Power Expansion Vital  To Economic Growth  Idaho has been blessed with an abundance  of resources-and a dynamic economic sys­tem  which has made use of them toward  continued economic growth and develop­ment  of a young, vigorous commonwealth.  The per capita tax in the state in 1953  was $61.34, only little more than half of the  $107.10 paid by every man, woman and child  for state services in nearhy Washington.  In the 10 years since the end of World  War II generation of power in the North­west  has doubled from 3Y2 to 7 million kw.  With the demand climbing by 7% each year  compounded annually it is estimated that  nine million additional kw. of power will be  required to keep pace with the growth of  the region in the next two decades.  Continued cooperation and pooling of all  private and federally built power will be  needed to combat the inevitable power  shortages that loom seven or eight years  away unless an accelerated program of  hydro electric construction is permitted.  Need All Capital Available  The federal gove111ment will be asked for  a billion dollars to complete its projects  now authorized, but much more money than  that will be required from investment cap­ital  and private sources if we are to con­tinue  to grow, expand and improve our  economic use of other resources and main­tain  the standard of living which we have  heretofore enjoyed.

Beyond 1955  the estimated dem811d for power is based on studies by the engineering  section of the Pacific Northwest Governors' Power Policy Committee, in  which all power agencies of the region have cooperated. Against this pic­ture  of steadily-rising demand are shown the region's power resources.  As of 1955 these resources, almost equally divided between local and  federal, are big enough to carry the load. Federal projects now under COIl­struction,  if kept on schedule, will meet the demand until approximately  1960. It takes from four to ten years to build large hydl"oelcctric plants.  That means these federal projects must be completed on schedule and  new projects must be sL:1rted NOW to fill the tremendous gap of 9,000,000  kilowatts between power needs and po,yer resources in the years from  1960 to 1970. And unless the gap is filled, the region's growth will be  seriously retarded. 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1036	1036	1037.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1037.pdfpage

This is twice the amount Congress has  appropriated for Federal power facilities in the Pacific Northwest in the  past ten yeArs-a period when this area was receiving some 40 per cent  of the lolal of such Cong,'cssiona) appropriations. This period also marked  the high point of Congressional spending for such purposes, To carry the  power supply job on from 1965 to 1970 will require an additional two and  )  one-hall billion dollars!

For many years the Pacific Northwest has led the nation in the large use  and low cost of electric service. These charts show that before the first  Feder"al power development was even started in the region, homes here  used more than twice the national average amount of electricity, and got  this energy for only about half the national average cost. This favorable  relationship has continued throughout the past 25 years. The aggressive  and for....ard-looking policies of the region's local utiljties made this record  possible, and the same philosophy of abundant, low-cost power is behind  their plans today for new hydroelectric developments in the area.  (While figures used in these charts are for Pacific Power & Light  Company, the use and cost figures of other systems in the region  follow the same general pattern.)  ) 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1039	1039	1040.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1040.pdfpage

It is  important La keep this relationship in mind when studying the region's  power supply problem. If generating costs are o\'cr-emphasized to the  point of blocking anything except tax-free, govenmlcnt-subsidized power  generation, the region will soon run OUl of power, and the resultant losses  will far exceed the narrow margin of illusory benefits from an oIl-Federal  program.  )) 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1040	1040	1041.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1041.pdfpage

Those of us  who are actively secking new industries have learned from actual experi­ence  that when an industrialist looks at a new arca he asks about raw  materials, markets, labor supply. transportation, political climate, com­munity  facilities and taxes. On thc subject of power, tbe typical indus­trialist  is most interested in the adequacy and dependability of power  supply. So long as power rates are fair and reasonable for the senrice  rendered, they normally playa very small part in the final decision. This  chart sho""s why. For U. S. industry as a whole, the cost of electric power  amounts to only a little more than one-half of aile per cent of the total  cost of the finished product. It is clear, therefore, that so long as we can  offer adequate power. we shall continue to see expansion of industry and  ) payrolls in the Pacific Northwest. But if we permit obstructionists to block  the development of new hydroelectric projects, we will surely run out of  power-and industrial growth will come to an abrupt halt! 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1041	1041	1042.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1042.pdfpage

PRESENT PLANS CALL  FOR THE INITIAL INSTALLATION OF THREE GENERAT­ING  UNITS AT EACH DAM, WITH SKElETON UNITS  INCORPORATED INTO THE POWERHOUSE STRUCTURE  TO ULTIMATELY ACCOMMODATE THREE ADDITIONAL  UNITS.  WHILE THE UNITS ALREADY INSTALLED AT  ICE HARBOR DAM ARE DESIGNED FOR A NAME­PLATE  RATING OF 90,000 KILOWATTS EACH, THE  THREE UNITS FOR LOWER MONUMENTAL, THE  SECOND UPSTREAM MULTIPURPOSE PROJECT, ARE  BEING DESIGNED TO PRODUCE 135,000 KILOWATTS  EACH. WITH A 15 PERCENT OVERLOAD INCORPORA­TED  INTO THE DESIGN OF EACH UNIT, THIS WILL  PROVIDE FOR AN INITIAL CAPACITY OF OVER 450,00:  KILOWATTS AT LOWER MONUMENTAL.  THE INITIAL POWER INSTALLATION FOR lITIlI  GOOSE IS ESTIMATED AT 405,000 KILOWATTS, WITH  THREE UNITS CARRYING A NAME-PLATE RATING Of  135,000 KILOWATTS EACH BEING INCLUDED IN THE  INITIAL POWERHOUSE DESIGN. ULTIMATE CAPACITY  FOR LITTlE GOOSE IS ESTIMATED AT 810,000 KILO­WATTS.  LOWER GRANITE'S HYDROELECTRIC POTEN­TIAliTY,  THOUGH STILL IN THE PLANNING STAGE,  WILL, UNDOUBTEDLY, BE COMPARABLE TO THE  KILOWATT OUTPUT Of LITTLE GOOSE. THE POWER  GENERATED BY THESE FOUR LOWER SNAKE RIVER  DAMS WILL ALL BE CHANNELED INTO THE NORTH­WEST  POWER POOL FOR REDISTRIBUTION THROUGH­OUT  THE NORTHWEST INDUSTRIAL AREA. 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1051	1051	1052.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1052.pdfpage

NUMEROUS  BENEFITS OTHER THAN THOSE USUALLY ATTRIBUTED  TO MULTIPURPOSE DAMS, NAMElY, NAVIGATION  RECREATION. IRRIGATION AND HYDROELECTRIC  POWER Will ACCRUE WITHIN THE SHORE LINE OF  THESE FOUR PROJECTS. THE IRRIGATION BENEFITS  WIll RESULT FROM A REDUCED PUMPING LIFT TO  IRRIGABlE LAND BORDERING THE SNAKE RIVER,  THE AVAILABILITY OF INCREASED POWER SUPPLY  Will ALSO MAKE IRRIGATION MORE FEASIBLE.  THE RESERVOIRS OF THE FOUR PROJECTS Will  COMPRISE A WATER AREA Of APPROXIMATELY 34,000  ACRES WITH A TOTAL SHORE LINE OF OVER 262MllES.  THE PAST EXPERIENCE, AS CONFIRMED BY THE  GROWTH OF INDUSTRY ALONG THE McNARY DAM  RESERVOIR SINCE ITS COMPLETION, MAKES REASON­ABLE  THE ASSUMPTION THAT A SIMILAR DEVELOP­MENT  WILL OCCUR AT THE MANY ACCESSIBLE SPOTS  ALONG THE SNAKE RIVER. THE FOUR DAMS BETWEEN  ITS MOUTH AND LEWISTON WILL CONSTITUTE A  CHANGE IN WATER LEVEL FROM:WO MSL AT THE  HEADWATERS OF THE McNA.RY POOL TO 735 AT  LEWISTON.  AS PLANNED, THE OPERATIONS WILL BE  SUCH AS TO MAINTAIN A RELATIVELY CONSTANT  WATER LEVEl OF 735 IN THE LEWISTON.-(LARKSTON  AREA. THIS WILL BE A.CCOMPlISHED BY VARYING  THE WATER SURFACE ElEVATION AT LOWER GRANITE  DAM ACCORDING TO RIVER FLOW. THIS WIll PERMIT  CONSTRUCTION Of HARBOR FACILITIES FOR DEEP  DRAFT EQUIPMENT IN THE LEWlSTON.-(LARKSTON  AREA, AS WELL AS ADAPTABILITY TO INDUSTRIAL  SHORE·lINE INSTALLATIONS. 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1052	1052	1053.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1053.pdfpage

Stotes and their politicol subdivisions may obtain use of  project lands and waters without cost and ore encouraged to de¥elop full pork and recreotion facil­ities  thereon. NumerOUS public ogencie-s ore developing and managing areas at a large number of  Civil Works projects.  Today, recreational opportunities Ofe becoming increasingly recognized as a new notionol  resource worthy of development to Q for greater degree thon heretofore. At Corps of Engineers  reservoirs, public use has jumped in one decade from 21 million visitors to 120 million visitors per  year. The 50 major projects patronized in 1950 have risen to more than 200 reservoir projects in  1961. The lands and waters mode ovailable for public use have doubled in the some period. The  new economic opportunities produced are substantial not only to the local communities involved  but nationally. As hundreds of new reservoirs ore constructed in the future, correspondingly more  recreational areas will become available to help meet the needs of the contry's expansion and growing  population.  6 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1067	1067	1068.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1068.pdfpage

Page 2									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														Since the time of early settlement of ow· country,  water resources have played a very important part  in the history and development of this nation. The  waterways were the paths the settlers and trappers  followed in the conquest of the wilderness. They  were the arteries of early commerce.  The first step toward the development and im·  provement of the nation's water resources by the  Federal Government was the authorization in 1820  hy the Congress of the United States for a survey  in connection with navigation on the Mississippi and  Ohio Rivers. This survey was assigned to the Corps  of Engineers.  Since that initial authorization, the Corps of  Engineers has constructed, improved and main­tained  the nation's harbors and navigable water­ways,  and assumed as directed by Congress a major  responsibility for the Federal Government's pro­gram  of flood control, shore protection and other  water resource uses.  The development and improvement of our natural  water resources in the interest of navigation, flood  control, water conservation and related purposes  provide vast expanses of water and shore line. Since  water is a prime factor in many recreation activities,  these resources provide for the American people an  enormous potential for outdoor recreational pw"Suits.  This potential has been recognized. As authorized  by Congress the Corps of Engineers provides recrea­tional  opportunities at its water resource develop­ment  projects.  :l  -~ ,  -~  --  ., ~- .. ~- a- .?  --- 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1082	1082	1083.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1083.pdfpage
Page 3									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														Outdoor Recreation  Outdoor recreation has become deeply embedded in the American way of life  through the close association of the outdoors with American traditions and past.  The majority of Americans seeking outdoor recreation wish to be near water areas  and to engage in water-associated activities such as swimming, fishing, water  skiing, boating, hunting, camping, and picnicking.  .- ----  Our expanding population, with more leisure time, more pill'chasing power,  and more mobility, continues to seek more opportunities to enjoy the outdoors.  The demand for outdoor recreation consequently has become greater each year.  The Corps of Engineers Civil Works Program, one  of conserving, developing and using the nation's water  resources contributes to the nation's outdoor-recrea­tional  opportunities through the construction, opera­tion,  and maintenance of reservoirs, harbors, and  waterways, and the protection and improvement of  coastal beach areas.  The benefits and opportunities afforded the Amel;­can  people through the multiple use of land and water  areas of water resource development projects have  become an important product of the Corps of Engi­neers  Civil Works Program. In view thereof, recrea­tion  as a purpose is now given full consideration along  with other purposes in the planning of water-resource  development projects. 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1083	1083	1084.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1084.pdfpage

OF THE ARMY ,~  Access  -'J. .- l •  The Corps of Engineers has made millions of acres of lands and new waters,  and many miles of waterways and beaches, available for recreational use. The  water areas of Corps of Engineers water resource development projects, when­ever  suitable for public recreation, are open to public use generally, without  charge, (or boating, swimming, bathing, fishing, and other recreational purposes.  In order that the public may enjoy the recreational opportunities afforded  by water resource development projects careful consideration is given to the  preservation of the natural scenic beauty of shore lines and to historic and  archeological resources. Public use areas are located conveniently to access roads  and generally have parking areas, overlooks, picnic tables and fireplaces, camp­grounds,  sanitary facilities, drinking water, boat launching ramps, and boat  docks. Recreational use and facilities are shown in following tables. Additional  information can be obtained from Project Information folders available at  Corps of Engineers offices.  Picnicking  Attractive locations have been selected and devel­oped  for both family picnicking and places where  family reunions or organizational groups can have a  day's outing. Facilities at both type picnic areas are  developed to meet the separate needs of each activity.  In addition to tables, fireplaces, and sanitary loca­tions,  the family type picnic areas are located near  inviting trails for exploration. The group picnic areas  have opportunities for games and demonstrations. 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1084	1084	1085.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1085.pdfpage
Page 5									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														Camping  Campgrounds are selected not only (or their beauty, spaciousness, and appro­priate  terrain but also for their accessibility to highways. Mobility is one of the  chief attractions of car camping. Campers find they can plan vacation tours of  several camps, stopping for two or three days at each. One of the main reasons  for the enormous popularity of camping as a family activity is the availability of  tents, travel trailers, camporettes, and other gear which help insure comfort  out of doors.  Today the entire family can answer the call of the wild in solid comfort, and  find new enjoyment and peace of mind, for camping is J'lealthy, inexpensive,  and fun. In addition, there are opportunities for pioneer and explorer camping  at sites ·usually accessible only by boats. Camp sites are also availahle at many  projects for youth groups travelling under sponsorship such as the Boy Scouts  of America.  Boat Launching  A wide range of facilities have heen provided at  which the visitor to Corps projects may launch his  hoat. These vary from cut-off highways which can he  used to multiple-lane concrete ramps to facilitate the  launching of boats in several lanes at one ramp simul­taneously.  The average family's small portable boat  can he launched at most ramps. Larger vessels must  he launched from special facilities generally located  at some of the concession sites or at special operational  areas. Unsafe boats are not permitted though those  which have passed State or Coast Guard regulations  generally meet all the requirements of the Corps  of Engineers. 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1085	1085	1086.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1086.pdfpage

Many areas are open to quail, pheasant, and rabbit hunting, while at others  there is deer hunting. Probably the largest number of hunters come for duck  and geese. Areas which are intensively used for general recreation are closed to  hunting. Certain Federal and State refuges located at these projects are also  closed to hunting.  •'-  To many, a camera offers more satisfaction than a gun. The many miles of  shore and trail offer plenty of opportunity to those interested in nature stuclies  to obtain still and action shots of a wide variety of wild life in its native habitat.  Fishing  Numerous fishing opportunities are available for  the skilled fishelman and for family fun. Fishing at  most Corps reselvoirs follows seasonal patterns. In  the northern reservoirs, fishing through the ice is  followed by spawning runs of walleye and sauger. At  most projects good fishing begins in March and con­tinues  on to June. During the summer months night  fishing fo.. bass and crappie is frequently good. In the  fall, bass and walleye fishing becomes good again.  Discharges from many of the dams often provide  good trout fishing. At many reselvoirs, concession­aires  offer heated and air-conditioned floating fishing  houses. At many reselvoirs, rough fish are removed  by commercial fishing practices. 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1086	1086	1087.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1087.pdfpage

The  large acreage of public waters and sborelands allows a wide latitude for conduct­ing  a supervised program of nature study, boating, sailing, and sport activities.  Organized camping is a very popular recreational-educational movement.  These camps are developed by cooperating Governmental agencies or youth  organizations. The camps provide a wholesome program of outdoor activities  during the summer season and are used to some extent for short periods  throughout the year.

The responsibility of making investigations and determining the most suit­able  method for protection, restoration, and development of beaches is assigned  to the Corps of Engineers by Congress.  Through cooperation with appropriate agencies of various states the Federal  Government participates in the construction of works for the restoration and  protection of the shores against erosion of waves and currents as a preservation  of recreational potentiality.  •  The shore lines of the United States, and especially the beaches, are a con­tinuing  source of recreational enjoyment. Of the many outdoor recreation  environments the shore line has an unusually strong appeal for the American  people. It offers a most enjoyable rec.reation use for large numbers of people.

Page 9									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														Waterways  The United States has been generally blessed with natural resources includ­ing  one of the greatest river systems and coastal and tidal estuaries in the world.  Approximately 23,000 miles of this system of inland and intracoastal waterways  have been improved and maintained by the Corps of Engineers.  The Mississippi River system furnishes an all-water route from the Gulf of  Mexico to Minneapolis, St. Paul, and ports along the Great Lakes, transit  between the plains of the west and the great industrial areas of the east.  A coastal waterway route along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts has been  accomplished by improving and interconnecting the many natural coastal water­ways.  This Intracoastal Waterway is a protected route. with some exceptions,  from Boston to the Mexican border, a distance of approximately 2,900 miles.  The interconnection of the intracoastal waterways with the Mississippi River  system and other important inland waterways enables small craft in the mid­west  and Great Lakes area to reach many points throughout the eastern and  southern seaboards and small craft along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts to reach  many points in the midwest and the Great Lakes area.  There was a time when the pleasure of using the waterways for recreational  purposes was reserved to those who could afford expensive yachts. Today with  increased purchasing power, more leisure time, mobility and the modern out·  board with boat trailers, use of the waterways comes within reach of the  general public.  Increasing use is being made of these waterways for recreation and sporting  purposes. Thousands of small boat owners each year cruise the waterways,  stopping frequently along the way or speeding along in small high power boats.  Whatever your pleasure, the waterways offer much to the outdoorsrnan and  his family.  Those who feel the urge to travel the waterways may obtain map folios for  various reaches of the waterways and locking regulations from Corps of Engi­neers  offices, and information relative to rules and regulations as to navigation  of the waterways and the craft in which they travel from the U. S. Coast Guard. 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1089	1089	1090.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1090.pdfpage

Cooperation With Other Agencies  At all stages of water·resow·ce development planning, project construction,  and operation, the Corps of Engineers encourages and effects close cooperation  with interested Federal, State, and local Governmental agencies. Through  joint planning with the agencies concerned with Parks, Recreation, Wildlife,  Health, Transportation, and Conservation, master plans are prepared to guide  the development and administration of the project. States and their political  subdivisions may and are encouraged to manage project lands and waters for  puhlic park recreation and wildlife purposes.  Some of the smaller reservoir areas are managed by the State for public  park purposes, while at others selected areas are managed by State, county  and municipal agencies for these purposes. A vast amount of fish and wildlife  research and management is carried forward on millions of acres of land and  water of Civil Works projects. 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1099	1099	1100.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1100.pdfpage

The concepts and philosophies which it ex­presses  have been evolved during the life of the Com­mission  since it was established by the 85th Congress.  This document addresses itseU to the history  and basic philosophy of the Commission. It is not an  eHort to report on our completed, current or proposed  work. This will be done in subsequent publications.  It is hoped that "What It Is and Does" will  serve as helpful background information (or those  interested in the work of the Commission. At appro­priate  later dates it will be supplemented by reports  on our studies l and of course the Commission's full  views and findings will appear in its final report.  This material was made available to the Ad­visory  Council as background material for its meeting  with the Commission on January 25-26, 1960.  Laurance S.

Page 4									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														What is the future of outdoor recreation in the  United States? During the rest of the present century,  what opportunities will people have to enjoy the host  of outdoor recreational activities which they are seek­ing  in rapidly increasing numbers? Will the supply,  as many fear, fall far short of the demand? Just  what are the facts; and if the prospect is disturbing,  just what can be done to improve the situation?  Questions such as these led Congress, through  passage of Public Law 85-470 of June 28, 1958, to  establish an Outdoor Rec reation Resources Review  Commission, with instructions to identify the prob­lems  and to recommend solutions. This action was  taken after thorough consideration and with the virtu­ally  unanimous approval of federal and state govern­mental  agencies, private organizations representing  a wide variety of interests, and individuals from many  walks of life.  The Act made the Commission an independent  body, without administrative duties or authority, but  with b:-oad investigative and advisory responsibilities  in an important, complex, and relatively unexplored  field. An appropriation of $2,500, 000 was authorized  and the Commission was instructed to submit its re­port  by September 1, 1961.  The preamble to the Act indicated the goals  which Congress had in mind:  "To preserve, develop, and secure  accessibility to all American people of  present and future generations such  quality and quantity of outdoor recrea-  -1- 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1105	1105	1106.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1106.pdfpage

"To inventory and evaluate the outdoor  recreation resources and opportunities  of the Nation, to determine the types  and location of such resources and op­portunities  which will be required by  present and future generations.  "To make comprehensive information  and recommendations leading to these  goals available to the President, the  Congress, and the individual States and  Territories. "  Congress clearly recognized that in this mech­anized  and urbanized twentieth century man cannot  afford to ignore the relationship between himself and  the world of nature, and that outdoor recreation con­stitutes  a valuable means of enjoying and benefiting  from that experience.  The commission consists of two majority and  two minority members of the Senate Committee on  Interior and Insular AIfalrs appointed by the President  of the Senate, two majority and two minority members  of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs  appointed by the Speaker of the House, and seven  citizens appointed by the President, including the  Chairman.  It held its first meeting on September 25, 1958.  The following year was devoted to the recruitment and  -2- 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1106	1106	1107.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1107.pdfpage
Page 6									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														organization of a staff, to the establishment of con­tacts  with public and private agencies interested in  outdoor recreation, to program planning, and to the  initiation of basic studies. Substantial funds for the  prosecution of the Commission's work did not become  available until September 1959.  The staff consists of a relatively small but  highly competent group, including an Executive Direc­tor  and a Deputy Director for Studies, under whom are  men in charge of inventory and government relations  andof forecasts and economic studies, with a support­ing  force of professional and clerical assistants.  Among the fields represented are economics, political  science, public administration, sociology, law, sta­tistics,  planning, and resource management. These  men are responsible for execution of the program of  studies approved by the Commission, with which they  will continually maintain close relations. They will  conduct investigations of their own, will supervise  studies handled by other agencies under grants or  contracts, will analyze, interpret, and evaluate the  material obtained, and will prepare the results for  consideration and action by the Commission.  The Commission is assisted by an Advisory  Council consisting of twenty-five members appointed  by the Commission and fourteen liaison officers ap­pointed  by the head of each federal department or in­dependent  agency which has a direct interest and re­sponsibility  in any phase of outdoor recreation. The  liaison officers facilitate contacts with the federal  agencies and provide an effective means of assuring  full use of their records and other resources.  The members of the Council appointed by the  Commission were chosen, as provided in the Act, as  representative of major geographical areas and also  a wide variety of state organizations, private organi­zations,  industries, and interests which are directly  -3- 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1107	1107	1108.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1108.pdfpage
Page 7									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														engaged in or affected by outdoor recreational activi­ties.  The Commission purposely included represen­tatives  of widely diverse interests and points of view  in its chief advisory body in order to assure full con­s  ideration of all facets and relationships of outdoor  recreation, including those that may be regarded as  adverse to other uses.  The Advisory Council attends at least two  meetings a year at which it advises on programs of  studies, questions of policy, and other similar mat­ters.  In the interim its members provide a useful  channel of communication between the Commission  and the agencies, organizations, and interests repre­sented.  The service of the COWlcil is increasing in  value as the Commission's work progresses.  At the request of the Commission, the Gov­ernors  of each of the fifty states, Puerto Rico, and  the Virgin Islands have designated Contact Officers  who provide a practical and appropriate source of in­formation  and cooperation. They will prove a great  asset in helping the Commission to make full use of  the wealth of data and experience which is available  in the various states.  Participation by the interested public in the  work of the Commission will be sought through national  and regional hearings. These hearings wil1 provide  opportunities for organizations and individuals to ex­press  their views and to make recommendations. The  Commission is also arranging for round-table dis­cussions,  seminars, and conferences with experts in  the subjects which it is studying.  The Act defined outdoor recreation resources  as meaning the land and water areas and associated  -4- 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1108	1108	1109.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1109.pdfpage
Page 8									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														)  resources which provide or may in the future provide  opportunities for outdoor recreation, irrespective of  ownership. Although recreation facilities, programs,  and opportunities usually associated with urban de­velopment  are excluded from our studies, we must  take into account the relationship which urban facili­ties  may have on the demand for developments outside  the city limits. While the Commission is not directed  to recommend ways and means of making adequate  provision for urban recreation, that field must be  studied because of its interrelations with "outdoor  recreation" .  The scope of the Commission's responsibilities  is broadened by the fact that "recreation" has a dual  meaning. It is the activity which uses leisure'time  for relaxation and enjoyment; and it is the refresh­mentof  body and spirit (the re-creation) which results  from that activity. It is both a means and an end.  One undertakes the activity of recreation for the pur­pose  of obtaining the result of re-creation.  This distinction is important from the stand­point  both of the individual and the community. The  activity has direct economic effects which can be  measured in dollars and cents. The result of the  activity may benefit the recreationist physically,  mentallyJ aesthetically, and spiritually, and thus  make him a better rounded individual and a more use­ful  citizen. These benefits, which can be measured  in monetary terms only imperfectly, if at all, have a  value as real as it is "intangible".  As a use of limited means, recreation imposes  a responsibility for the wise allocation of scarce re­sources  among alternative uses; and as a source of  personal satisfaction and development to those who  engage in it, recreation imposes the further responsi-  -5- 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1109	1109	1110.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1110.pdfpage
Page 9									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														bility of exercising policy in such a manner that the  widest possible dispersion of benefits is achieved.  In addition to the general orientation of the  Commission's activities provided by the preamble,  specific instructions concerning subjects to be covered  are included in the oody of the Act. The entire pro­gram  provides for the first time for a national and  comprehensive study of all aspects of outdoor recre­ation-  -picnicking, camping, fishing, hunting, swim­ming,  skin diving, water skiing, boating, hiking,  motoring, and so on-- with a view to proposing plans  for coordinated action by public and private agencies  in providing adequate opportunities for outdoor recre­ation  for all Americans. The emphasis is on people  and on ways and means of meeting their prospective  desires and needs as individuals and as members of  society.  To handle successfully the large and complex  undertaking assigned to the Commission, in the short  time and with the limited funds specified by the Act,  will require intensive effort, with widespread coop­eration  and full use of information already available  from every possible source.  Congress directed the Commission to prepare  a "nationwide inventory of outdoor recreation re­sources  and opportunities." Such an inventory is an  essential accompaniment of the estimates of prospec­tive  requirements, which are of little signUicance  without knowledge of the means to meet them. It is  being approached from three angles:  1. Inventorying and evaluating public parks,  forests, lakes, streams, reservoirs, and other land  and water areas already available and designated for  -6- 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1110	1110	1111.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1111.pdfpage
Page 10									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														recreational use. The necessary data will be fur­nished  chiefly by appropriate federal, state, and local  agencies. Two pilot studies -- in Washington and  Pennsylvania -- have laid the foundation for more  comprehensive national studies which will provide  detailed information on such items as location, size,  characteristics, use, management, administrative  problems, and plans for future use.  2. Developing a broad picture of the capacity  of other land and water resources, 'irrespective of  ownership, to provide opportunities for outdoor recre­ation.  This information will necess.arily be much  more general than that for public areas already de­voted  to recreational use, but will give a fairly accu­rate  picture of the areas' availability to meet mounting  pressures. Special attention will be paid to lands  accessible to major centers of population. Full use  will be made of data already available through various  public agencies and private landowners.  In estimating the ability of land and water  areas in both this and the previous category to support  recreational activities of different kinds, considera­tion  must be given to the "carrying capacity", that is,  the number of people for whom such areas can provide  satisfying recreational experiences. This capacity  will vary both with different conditions of soil, topog­raphy,  precipitation, and vegetative cover and with  the kind of recreation involved. It is much greater,  for example, with picnic and camp grounds than with  wilderness areas.  3. Studying special regions and special kinds  of recreational areas. Alaska, for example, will re­ceive  particular attention because of the inadequacy  of present knowledge of the extent, character, acces­sibility,  present and prospective use, and potential  economic importance of its recreational resources.  -7 - 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1111	1111	1112.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1112.pdfpage
Page 11									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														The wholly different recreational opportunities and  problems of Hawaii also merit a close look.  Intensive and objective studies of wilderness  problems will provide a sound basis for recommenda­tions  in a field marked by strong partisanship and  widely varying viewpoints. They will deal with such  matters as the definition of wilderness, the character  and significance of wilderness values, criteria for  comparing wilderness and other values (both recrea­tional  and commercial), the justifiable extent of  wilderness areas (how much is enough?), and prob­lems  of administration and management.  Shorelines and beaches on salt water and the  Great Lakes are a unique recreational asset which  warrant special studies. These will determine the  location, character, and availability of areas suitable  for recreational use, means of preventing pollution  and other damage, and measures needed to assure  public access to them. Inland lakes and streams,  which comprise one of the greatest unrealized oppor­tunities  for recreational use, will receive comparably  intensive study.  Since the value of natural resources to people  lies in their actual or potential use, Congress in­structed  the Commission to "determine the amount,  kind, quality, and location of such outdoor recreational  resources and opportunities as will be required by the  year 1976 and the year 2000"; and also to plan for  providing "such quality and quantity of outdoor recre­ation  resources as will be necessary and desirable  for individual enjoyment, and to assure the spiritual,  cultural, and physical benefits that such outdoor  recreation provides. "  -8- 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1112	1112	1113.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1113.pdfpage
Page 12									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														)  Compliance with these sweeping mandates will  require an intensive study of past, present, and future  trends, in which both history and prophecy will play  a prominent part. A first step is to determine what  the American people now "require" in the way of out­door  recreation, recognizing that "requirements"  result from a desire, or preference, for a particular  form or forms of outdoor recreation plus the means  and the time to translate the desire into action.  The Commission has consequently initiated a  nation-wide survey to find out the ways in which people  of every sort and description actually spend their  leisure time, in what other ways they would prefer to  spend it if they had the means, the reasons for their  preferences, and their evaluation of the benefits  derived. The data will be 50 collected as to provi~e  information concerning the relationship between rec­reational  activities and such items as occupation, age,  sex, income, marital status, size of family, length  o( vacation, and place o( residence (city, farm, East,  West, etc.). It will also determine about those who  participate in outdoor recreation, where they go, how  often and (or how long, how (ar they travel, what  means of transportation they use, where they stay  (hotels, motels, camps, etc.), how much they spend,  what (acilities they prefer for different kinds o( rec­reation  (hunting, fishing, camping, picnicking, skiing,  boating, etc.), why they chose the form and place of  recreation which they did, and what they feel they got  out of the experience.  The results of the survey will be statistically  significant for the country as a whole. They will also  have considerable validity for major regions and per­haps  (or smaller geographical di visions.  Since the great bulk of the population now lives  in urban and suburban centers, more intensive studies  -9- 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1113	1113	1114.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1114.pdfpage
Page 13									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														will be made in several representative metropolitan  areas. Because of the large number of people involved,  it is essential tobaveaccurate information concerning  their "requirements" for outdoor recreation, both  quantitatively and qualitatively, and concerning the  factors which influence these requirements. These  studies also will have statistical significance.  Understanding of present and probable future  activities and preferences in outdoor recreation will  be sharpened by historical studies of past trends and  of the factors chiefly" responsible for them. The road  we have already travelled gives at least some indica­tion  of the road we are likely to travel in the future.  Even more important in projecting "requirements" is  a rigorous analysis of the factors by which they are  controlled. These include the number, character, and  location of the population in 1976and 2000, the amount  and distribution ofleisuretime. the per capita dispos­able  income, the transportation facilities available,  and the costs of travel. Determination of the changes  that will take place in these factors in the next forty  years is difficult. Still more difficult is interpreta­tion  of the probable influence of these changes on the  uses which people will choose to make of their leisure  time and of their preferences within the field of out­door  recreation when that field is their choice. Both  difficulties increase as the period under consideration  is extended. but within limits can be overcome.  This situation has led the Commission to initi­ate  a study of the social and economic trends and of  the patterns of living that have affected the use made  by Americans of their leisure time in the past and that  are likely to do so in the future. Growing urbaniza­tion,  technological developments in transportation and  other fields, foreign travel. advertising campaigns by  equipment manufacturers, transportation agenCies,  tourist bureaus, and Chambers of Commerce. changes  -10- 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1114	1114	1115.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1115.pdfpage
Page 14									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														in educational standards and content, expansion of  cultural interests, and modification or elimination of  old recreational opportunities or development of new  ones, may all have a material impact on the kind and  amount of outdoor recreation that people will seek.  Closely associated with these trends are the  spiritual, cultural, and physical benefits derived from  outdoor recreation. Does it make the recreationist  healthier, more vigorous, more cooperative, more  efficient, more appreciative of the Iiner things in lire,  more conscious of his civic responsibilities? These  are important questions, since in a maturing society  people will, and should, turn more and more to uses  of leisure time which yield lasting rewards in personal  and social development, rather than to those which  afford only temporary enjoyment.  Identification of the character and duration of  these values, so far as practicable, their measure­ment,  and ways and means of enhancing them will be  examined by experts in such fields as psychology,  sociology, anthropology, medicine, and education.  Suggestions for practical programs that will teach  people how to behave and to take care of themselves in  the open, how to safeguard the recreational resources  which they use, how to appreciate the myriad geolog­ical,  physical, and biological manifestations of nature,  how to imbibe spiritual inspiration from the outdoors  -- in short, how to obtain maximum satisfactions from  outdoor recreation -- may well be important products  of such studies.  Investigations along all of these lines, as in­structed  by Congress, are essential for a reasonably  reliable estimate of prospective pressures and for an  intelligent appraisal of the benefits to be expected  from various forms of outdoor recreation. Combined  with the inventories and with studies of competing  uses, they will provide the basis for estimating the  -11- 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1115	1115	1116.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1116.pdfpage
Page 15									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														kind and amount of land and water and of streams and  shorelines needed and available to meet anticipated  pressures.  Recognition of the importance of the country's  land and water resources for uses other than outdoor  recreation is contained in the statement by Congress  that "sound planning of resource utilization for the full  future welfare of the Nation must include coordination  and integration of. . . multiple uses. "  A zooming population and steadily rising stand­ards  of living will inevitably exert increasing pres­sures  on natural resources of all kinds, including  space itself. We shall need more minerals, more  wood, more livestock, and perhaps more agricultural  crops. The expansion of urban and suburban centers,  highways, and airports will remove much land from  other uses. Demands will mount for the use of water  for municipal and industrial purposes, for irrigation,  and for power,  How will outdoor recreation fare in competi­tion  with these other pressures? The answer will de­pend  in part on the compatibility of recreational use  with other uses and in part on the value placed. on rec­reation  by the American people in comparison with  other products and services obtainable from land and  water.  "Multiple use" has gradually come to be re­garded  by some as the solution for all of our land-use  problems, although there is wide difference of opinion  as to its meaning, application, and practical signifi­cance.  In essence, it aims to manage all of the varied.  resources of an administrative unit in a way that will  best achieve the objectives of the owner. It may pro-  -12-  ) 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1116	1116	1117.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1117.pdfpage
Page 16									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														duce a more varied and larger joint product than "sin­gle  use", but it cannot do away with the facts that not  all uses are compatible and that all of several products  or services cannot be maximized on any given area,  no matter what its size.  The conditions under which and the extent to  which recreation and other uses are compatible or  incompatible will be studied by the Commission. In  other words, it will explore the potentialities and the  limitations of multiple use as a means of providing  adequate opportunities for outdoor recreation in com­petition  or in coordination with other uses. Where  irreconcilable conflicts between uses exist, the deci­sion  as to which should dominate must be based on  relative values. Here the economic and social studies  already discussed have an important contribution to  make.  The Commission is enjoined by Congress to  "recommend what policies should best be adopted and  what programs be initiated, at each level of govern­ment  and by private organizations and other citizen  groups and interests, to meet future requirements. "  This charge raises the whole question of the  responsibility of different levels of government and of  private interests to provide the recreational opportu­nities  and facilities which will be needed in the next  fifteen to forty years. What do the past records and  present activities of different agencies (federal, state,  county, and private) indicate as to their relative effec­tiveness  in providing the needed quantity, quality,  and distribution of recreational opportunities and  facilities? What are the prospects for the future?  Why have public agencies so far taken such a major  -13- 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1117	1117	1118.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1118.pdfpage
Page 17									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														part, and private owners such a minor part, in this  particular field?  Answers to such questions as these, which  will be sought by the Commission, will throw light on  the principles and the practical considerations which  should govern the assignment of responsibility. They  will be helpful to the Commission in proposing criteria  for determining where responsibility should be as­signed  as between and within different levels of  government.  The potential role of private lands is of par­ticular  importance because they occupy three-fourths  of the land area of the country and because they com­prise  the great bulk of land ownership in the East  where the density of population is greatest. The Com­mission  will therefore pay special attention to ways  and means of using a larger part of this tremendous  area in such a strategic location for recreational pur­poses.  Will private owners voluntarily go much fur­ther  in this direction than they have in the past as a  means of reaping a financial profit or of building up  goodwill? II not, what can be done to increase their  interest? For example, would some public encourage­ment  in such forms as subsidies, tax remissions,  leases, or the construction of recreational improve­ments  be both desirable and effective?  The institutional and legal framework within  which lands and waters are managed has an important  influence on the problem of responsibility which the  Commission must study. What, for example, are  the laws governing public waters and the rights of  riparian owners in different parts of the Country?  What are the legislative provisions for land manage­ment  encouraging or controlling the practice of  forestry on private lands and the use of such land for  recreation? What is the influence of zoning on recre­ation?  What is the constitutional and statutory au-  -14- 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1118	1118	1119.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1119.pdfpage
Page 18									http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/dworshak/														thority of various levels of government in this field?  With respect to programs, what should be the  practice of government ag~ncies and. private owners  in sucb matters as fees, facilities, and education?  How should these practices vary with the different  kinds of recreation? How can overcrowding which is  detrimental from both the physical and the aesthetic  standpoints be avoided? These are questions on which  information will be obtained from some of the studies  previously described, but in the answering of which  opinion will still have to play an important part.  Congress' final instruction to the Commission  was to recommend "means wher.eby the review may  effectively be kept current in the future. "  The Commission is a temporary body which  ceases to exist not later than one year after submis­sion  of its final report. That report will cover all of  the subjects assigned to it by Congress. It will con­tain  an analysis and interpretation of the numerous  studies which it undertakes, together with recommen­dations  as to policies which it believes should be  adopted. These recommendations will be based on  thorough study of the information and of the views  which it has been able to obtain from all possible  sources. It will represent the Commission's best  judgment as to the policies and'programs which should  be adopted in the field of outdoor recreation in the  best interests of "all American people of present and  future generations.

Time will be required to find and  to apply solutions to many current problems, and new  problems will keep appearing. Continuing change is  inevitable.  The Commission will therefore devise and  recommend a plan which will aim to assure continu­ing,  comprehensive, and coordinated consideration  and study of problems in the field of outdoor recrea­tion  by appropriate public and private agencies.  -16- 			2011-05-16	2011-05-16	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1120	1120	1121.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1121.pdfpage

Page 2																							DfJ YfJIJ WIINT  ----TH/1-fJR-THIS------t  WIPED OUT-Runs of Steelhead Trout, Chi­nook  Salmon, and hundreds of miles  of cascading mountain streams.  FLOODED-Vital winter ranges of Elk, Mule  Deer, and White-Tailed Deer.  SCARRED AND DENUDED- Hillsides and  valleys; wild and natural beauty ruined  by fluctuating shorelines of artificial  reservoirs.  GONE FOR ALL TIME-48 miles of the mag­nificent  gorge of the North Fork of The  Clearwater River.  HETCH HETCHY HAS HAD IT  WHY? People were fooled by the old refrain ''There  are no alternatives; we must have Hetch Hetchy."  There were alternatives then. There still are. Just  a few miles down stream was another site that would  have met the needs without the resulting devasta­tion.  Because of this action the beautiful counter·  part of neighboring Yosemite valley, Hetch Hetchy  valley was blotted out-a mistake that cannot be  changed.  Wild country-rich in native trout and big  game.  The splendor of great forests and rock­rimmed  mountain ranges.  Dashing, unspoi led, crystal-clear mountain  streams.  The scemc majesty of canyon gorges.  IT NEED NOT HAPPEN HERE  There are alternatives to Bruces Eddy that will meet  the requirements of flood control and hydroelectric  power. But once again, the arguments are mar­shalled  that only Bruces Eddy can meet the needs.  Once again, there will be specific benefits to some.  Though constructed by public funds, power com­ponies  will sell power. Lumber companies can  transport more lumber at less expense. The local  community will receive benefits from construction  activity. Whatever the merits of specific benefits,  they cannot surmount the fearsome cost of irreplace­able  resources to the nation. Bruces Eddy, once  done, cannot be undone.  YOU CAN PREVENT THIS DESTRUCTION  Write your Representative, your Senators, and the President why you oppose Bruces Eddy Dam 			2012-02-17	2012-02-17	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1134	1134	1135.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1135.pdfpage
Page 3																							LEGEND  WHAT IS THE CURRENT THREAT?  Bruces Eddy Dam is included in the Omnibus Rivers  and Harbors PHI. Its proponents will make every  effort to have this Congress authorize the project  before the studies on fish, wildlife, and recreation  are completed.  WHAT RESOURCES WOULD  BRUCES EDDY DAM DESTROY?  FISH: Bruces Eddy Dam, 570 feet high, would mean  the end of steelhead trout and chinook salmon runs.  Some of the best trout fishing in North America  would be wiped out.  In 1955, more than 42,000 trout were caught by  fishermen on the North Fork; 60% of these were  steelhead that would be knocked out by Bruces  Eddy! Although once blocked by a low downstream  dam, the present runs of steelhead trout show a  great potential for increase. Bruces Eddy would pre­vent  this recovery of a valuable fisheries resource.  GAME: The largest elk herd in the world winters  along the Clearwater. In low valley wintering areas,  like the 48-mile length of canyon that would be  flooded by Bruces Eddy Dam, thousands of elk,  mule deer, and whitetailed deer starve when severe  winters bring food shortages.  State and Federal wildlife agencies have begun  studies authorized by Congress to learn the extent  of the destruction of game range by the Bruces Eddy  project. Dam supporters want Congress to author­ize  the dam before these investigations are com­pleted.  Aside from wasting the public funds that  have been spent on the studies, if this "cart before  If'  the horse" approach is followed, it will mean that  the devastating effects of this dam on fish, wildlife,  and other outdoor recreation resources will not be  determined until the dam building already is under  way!-Then no one can undo the destruction!  SCENIC BEAUTY: Bruces Eddy Dam would flood  thousands of acres of the North Fork of the Clear­water  Canyon. Scenic drives through winding, for­ested  canyons, along one of the most beautiful  mountain rivers of the Northwest, would be replaced  by an artificial reservoir, ugly scarred canyon walls,  stump fields, and mud flats.  Thousands of people from over the entire country  now visit the Clearwater. Bruces Eddy Dam would  sacrifice a great part of the promising recreational  future of the North Fork. Use of the flooded area  by fishermen, hunters, hikers, and other outdoor  enthusiasts would drop practically to zero.  WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES  TO BRUCES EDDY?  The most serious flood threat is on the Columbia  River and certain tributaries-not on the Clear­water.  Since records have been kept, this river has  flooded only twice (in 1933 and 1948).  Other dam sites are superior to Bruces Eddy in meet·  ing this primary flood threat, and each would pro­vide  greater capacity for power without destroying  valuable wildlife and scenic resources. Each of the  alternate sites available would provide well over  twice the water storage capacity of Bruces Eddy,  and each of them would provide an installed capac­ity  for hydroelectric power two to three times that  available at Bruces Eddy.  PAST REJECTIONS OF BRUCES EDDY  Several unsuccessful attempts have been made by  the Corps of Engineers to get Congressional author­ization  and appropriation for Bruces Eddy Dam. The  first, in 1954, died in committee without action.  In 1955, strong public protest blocked a $100,-  000 detailed planning appropriation for Bruces Eddy  in the Public Works appropriation bill. Attempts to  gain appropriations in 1956 met similar defeat. But  in August, 1956, Bruces Eddy Dam got through  Congress by Senate amendment in the giant $1.6  billion Omnibus Rivers and Harbors Bill, a package  authorization of hundreds of river and harbor de­velopments  throughout the entire country. The  amendment to include this project met with strong  bi-partisan opposition from leading conservation  spokesmen in Congress, but only hurried hearings  were held by the Senate Committee. The entire bill  was killed by President Eisenhower, who said, in  his veto message, that Congress had acted on "in­complete  information" in authorizing many of the  projects in this bill.

Page 2																							A Key To Area Development:  Hydro Power, Flood Control  Bruce's Eddy dam and reservoir will be op­erated  as a key part of the multiple purpose  development of the water resources of the  Columbia River basin. It will play a major  role in alleviating flood control damage and  power shortages that have been felt in the  past.  Proposed operation of the reservoir con­templates  keeping the pool area full during  the summer months for power generation  and to make a beautiful lake for recreation,  summer homes and other aesthetic uses.  The lake level would be lowered during the  period of low water from November until  spring to supplement downstream flow and  to provide space to catch flood waters which  normally occur in May. This would prevent  downstream damage in the Clearwater, Co­lumbia  and Snake rivers proper.  About two million acre feet of storage is  usable for river control purposes.  After the disastrous 1948 flood it became  evident that control of the Clearwater river  was imperative. The Clearwater has the  highest fluctuation, from 500 second feet to  177,000 second feet, of any major river in the  Northwest. The North Fork alone flows an­nually  4,000,000 acre feet and runs as high as  6,680,000 acre feet.  Least lniury To Area  The Bruce's Eddy project is designed to  give the Pacific Northwest the maximum  benefits with the least amount of distur-b­ance  and injury to salmon runs or to estab­lished  communities. Its completion will add  to the use of the North Fork area which is  now isolated and inaccessible by automobile  for much of the reservoir pool area.  Commands Extensive Support  Expressic:ms of approval have been made by the  following organizations on the Clearwater Dams.

Effective flood control.  2. Dependable at-site power.  3. Impressive downstream power firming  benefits.  4. Immediate construction access.  5. Insignificant damage or disruption to  the economy of North Central Idaho or to  travel routes of its people.  · 6. Impressive benefits in making access­ible  large bodies of private, state and fed­eral  timber now not harvestable.  7. No encroachment on lands dedicated  to recreation, big game or wild life use.  8. Development of 534,000 kilowatts of  power will provide opportunity for added  investment of private capital in Clearwater  county, broadening the tax base and provid­ing  badly needed stimulus to a depressed  lumber area.  Need Upstream Storage  Upstream storage such as provided by  Bruce's Eddy is vital to the success of the  lower Snake River navigation development,  for which the Inland Waterways Association  and local interests have worked so diligently  during the past 20 years.  Power Expansion Vital  To Economic Growth  United support for the project from Ida­ho's  congressional d e I e gat ion has been  pledged. The continued development of the  state and region is contingent upon ample  supplies of power and with the delay of Bri­tish  Columbia in ratification of plans for up­per  Columbia river development and Libby  dam, early action on the Clearwater project  is most pressing. 			2012-02-17	2012-02-17	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1138	1138	1139.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1139.pdfpage

Improved Fishing Seen  Plans of the army engineers encompass a  tremendous program for rehabilitation of  fish and wildlife resources in the Bruce's Ed­dy  pool area. Hatchery developments are be­ing  studied and it is assured that the medi­ocre  fishing which has characterized the  North Fork will be replaced by a fishery  second to none in Idaho.  Exhaustive studies by state and federal  agencies have demonstrated that there will  be minor dislocation of wildlife in the pool  area and that an infinitismal portion of Id'a­ho's  80,000 elk will be adversely affected.  Development of a local fishery will provide  sport fishing for thousands of reservoir vis­itors  and more than compensate for any im­pediment  the dam may offer to runs of an­adromous  fish.

ARTIST'S CONCEPTION OF DWORSHAK DAM  DWORSHAK DAM AND RESERVOIR REPRESENTS A MOST  IMPORTANT UNIT IN THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS' COMPRE­HENSIVE  PROGRAM FOR THE FULL DEVELOPMENT OF THE  WATER RESOURCES OF THE COLUMBIA- SNAKE RIVER DRAIN­AGE  AREA. THE NORTH FORK OF THE CLEARWATER IS A  MAJOR FLOOD PRODUCING STREAM. THE DWORSHAK PRO­JECT  WILL SERVE TO REGULATE THE CLEARWATER RIVER FLOW  FROM AHSAHKA TO ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE SNAKE AT  LEWISTON.  DWORSHAK RESERVOIR WILL HAVE A MAXIMUM POOL  ELEVATION OF 1,600 FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL AND A MINI  MUM OF 1,445 FEET. THE DWORSHAK RESERVOIR, AT MAX­IMUM  POOL, WILL EXTEND 53 MILES UPSTREAM AND COVER  AN AREA OF 17,000 ACRES. THE WATER STORAGE CAPACITY  OF THE RESERVOIR WILL BE 3,500,000 ACRE-FEET OF WHICH  2 MILLION ACRE-FEET WILL BE USABLE FOR FLOOD CONTROL  AND POWER PURPOSES.

Page 3																							-  ..  ••  ••  PREFACE  The development of this notion's resources sometimes necessitates the acquisi­t  ion of private property for pub I ic use. Such is the case in the construction of the  Bruces Eddy Dam and Reservoir, which was authorized in Section 201 of the Flood  Control Act of 1962, Pub I ic Low 87-874, approved 23 October 1962. Construction  funds were appropriated in the Public Works Appropriation Act, 1963, Public Low  87 • 880, approved 24 October 1962.  This brochure was prepared as a ready reference for landowners as to the basic  pol icy of the Deportment of the Army, acting through the Corps of Engineers, in the  acquisition of privately owned property. It also very briefly covers relocation of  roods and utilities as requ ired for the construction, operation and maintenance of  the Bruces Eddy Dam and Reservoir Project. This brochure is prepared in com pi ionce  with Section 302, Public Low 86-645, approved 14 July 1960.  The Corps • pol icy is to endeavor to be fair, realistic, and to pay market value  of the property token and to limit real estate requirements to the minimum acreage.  It is also the pol icy to cooperate in solving the problems confronting property owners  whose property is token.  While it is recognized that this brochure will not answer all the questions that  may arise, particularly personal, the following should cover questions most frequent­ly  asked . 			2012-02-17	2012-02-17	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1153	1153	1154.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1154.pdfpage

Page 6																							•  •  ••  l  WHY IS THE LANDOWNER'S PROPERTY NEEDED?  The location of the dam was selected after long and deta iled studies  both prior and subsequent to the Act of Congress which authorized its construction.  This project is a unit of the general comprehensive plan for the development of  the water resources of the Middle Snake River and tributaries. It is designed pri ­marily  for flood control and to produce hydro-electric powe r. Collateral bene­fits  to irrigation, recreation, and fish and wildlife also will result. Studies re ­vealed  the site of the dam to be the most practical to secure the maximum pub lic  benefits for the entire project.  2. WHAT LAND WILL BE BOUGHT BY THE CORPS?  The Corps will purchase all lands in fee required for the damsite, con­~  t r uction areas, pe rmanent structures, public access and operation and maintenance  of the reservoir, righ ts of way for relocation of utilities, roads and lands below the  maximum flowage line including a freeboard allowance.  Freeboard is established above the top pool to allow for effects of wove  action, sloughing and bank erosion, saturation, deposit of debris and other adverse  effects of backwater. Where this freeboard does not provide a minimum of 300 feet  horizontally from elevation 1600 feet m.s.l., it will be increased to that extent .  No private ownerships will remain within this minimum acquisition. Present planning  does not coli for any flowage easement acquisition in this project. The project ta k­ing  I ine wi II normally follow legal subdivisions of original surveyed sections where  practical or where topography dictates along long tangents and along right of way  lines of relocated roads, etc.  This brochure does not include coverage of related lands for the U. S.  Fish and Wildlife Service .  3. WHAT PERSONAL PROPERTY WILL THE CORPS BUY?

Page 7																							•  •  ••  s  gether with improvements the..eon, but does not include items of personal property  such as readily removable household furnishings, farm machinery, etc.  4. WHAT IS AN APPRAISAL?  An appraisal is an estimate and opinion of value by a professional real  estate appraiser. In this instance the estimate will be the fair market value. A  common definition of fair market value is: 11The 9mount in cash, for which in all  probability the property would be sold by an owner willing but ~t obligated to  sell to a purchaser who desires but is not obi igated to buy. 11 In estimating the fair  market value, the appraiser uses, where opplicable, the three cemmonly accepted  approaches to value, namely: The Market Data Approach, or comparable sales;  the Reproduction Cost Less Depreciation Approach; and the Income Approach.  The appraisals are generally pr~ared by staff employees, ho\olllever, in some in­stances  when workload requires or unusual voluation problems are encountered,  services of independent professional appraisers are obtained by contract.  5. WHAT IS AN OFFER TO SELL?  An offer to sell, or as it is usually called, an 11offer 11  , is the basis for  an agreement or contract between the property owne r and the Corps and setting  forth the price and te rms of sale. It is helpful for both the property owner and the  Corps to have an offer to se II signed as both parties wi II then know where they  stand with respect to what the Corps wi II pay and the terms and conditions of the  sale.  6. WHEN WILL THE PROPERTY OWNER BE CONTACTED RELATIVE TO  PURCHASE OF HIS PROPERTY?  Upon completion of appraisal of a property, a representative of the  Corps will call upon the property owner to present the Government•s offer for pur­chase  of the property and discuss any problems. If the offered price is acceptable  to the property owner, he wi ll be asked to sign a contract to sell. Acquisition of  real estate for th is project will extend from early 1963 to the end of 1968.  2 			2012-02-17	2012-02-17	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1157	1157	1158.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1158.pdfpage
Page 8																							••  7. WHAT HAPPENS IF THE CORPS' OFFER IS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO THE  PROPERTY OWNER?  If every reasonable effort has been made in discussions with the Corps 1  representative to come to an agreement and the property owner and the Corps can­not  agree on the terms and conditions of sale, then the Corps will request the local  Federal Court to decida the fair market value of the property. This iG accomplished  through what is called a "Condemnation Proceeding".  8. WHAT IS A CONDEMNATION PROCEEDING?  It is a me thod ..,f acquiring proper1y needed for the project where the  value of the prcperty cannot be agreed upon between the property owner and the  Corps. It may also be used to acquire property where title to such property is en­cumbered  or clouded. When a condemnation proceeding is instituted to remove the  encumbrance or cloud and there is no dispute between the pro pert¥ owner and the  Corps as to the price of the land, he will be called on only to assist the United States  Attorney as much as he can. On the other hand, if the property owner and the Unit­ed  States cannot agree as to the value of this property, it will be necessary that the  condemnation case be brought to trial before the United States District Court having  jurisdication. The trial ·will be conducted in accordance with the established rules  and procedures of such courts . No attempt is made here to relate such rules and pro­cedures;  each side will be permitted to present its evidence to the court for the pur­pose  of supporting its view as to value of the property being acquired. The court or  jury then will determine the fair market value of the property.  9. WHAT HAPPENS IF OWNER'S TITLE IS DEFECTIVE?  The law requires the Attorney General of the United States to pass upon  the adequacy of the title to the property owner's land before it can be bought by the  United States. If the Attorney General determines that the title is so defective that  it cannot be cured, the Corps will not pay the property owner immediately for the  property, but will be required to file a condemnation and deposit the estimated fair  3 			2012-02-17	2012-02-17	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1158	1158	1159.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1159.pdfpage
Page 9																							• &  •  market value with the court. If the property owner and the Corps have already  agreed on price, the court is so advised and judgment wi II be entered on the basis  of this agreed price. The court will clear title at no cost toGthe property owner.  10.. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE CORPS TAKES ONLY PART OF AN  OWNERSHIP?  If only part of the ownership is needed for the project, the appraiser  will moke an investigation of the entire ownership to determine how this will affect  the remaining property. In those cases where the port remaining is less valuable  than it was before, on allowance for this damage will be included in the appraisal.  This is commonly called "severance damage" and will be included with the over­all  settlement.  11. WHAT RESETTLEMENT EXPENSES CAN THE PROPERTY OWNER EX -  PECT FROM THE CORPS IN ADDITION TO PAYMENT OF FAIR MARKET VALUE  FOR HIS PROPERTY?  Under low the Secretory of the Army is authorized to reimburse both  owners and tenants for certain expenses, iosses and damages which they incur in  the process and as a di rect result of the moving of themselves, their families, and  their possessions .because of the acquisition of land for reservoir projects. To'Se­cure  reimbursement, it is necessa ry that owners and tenants make written applica­tion  within one year following the dote of acquisition o r within one year following  the dote that the property is vacated by the applicant, whichever dote is later.  When the Corps acqui res title, the Corps will notify all owners and tenants by  letter of thei r right to make oppiication for reimbursement and will furnish them  fo rms fo r the purpose. The oppl icotion for reimbursement must be supported by on  itemized statement of the expenses, losses, and damages incurred. T-he low, how­ever,  provides that the total amount of reimbursement to be paid to the owners and  tenants of any parcel of land acquired shall in no event exceed 25% of the fair  va I ue of the parce I of land. The Corps wi II fu rnish such i nformotion and assist-  4 			2012-02-17	2012-02-17	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1159	1159	1160.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1160.pdfpage
Page 10																							•  •  'Jnce in mak1ng the appl icotion for reimbursement, os requested.  12. WHAT SALVAGE RIGHTS TO BUILDINGS DOES THE PROPERTY OW-NER  HAVE?  In general, if the owner wishes to retain buildings and improvements  and move them to another location outside the ~·eservoir boundary, he may do so by  including o provision in the offer. The solvoge value of the buildings or improve­ments  is deducted from the purchase price . This salvage value takes in¥&gt; consider­ation  the fact that the owner must move the reserved improvements and reasonably  clean up the site at his own expense and by a specified date. The salvage value is  estimated by the app1 aiser on the basis of what the improvements would bring if of­fe1  ed for bid 1n the open market for off-site removal with reasonable site clean up  requ tremcnts.  13. WHEN WILL THE PROPERTY OWNER GET HIS MONEY?  The Corps 1ecogn ize:. that a property owner may need his money in order  to buy another place and wi II pay him just as soon as it can after an offer has been  accepted and the Attorney General of the United States has approved his title. If  the property is acquired by a condemnation proceeding, the amount the Corps esti­mates  the property to be worth is deposited in The Registry of the local United States  D;strict Court and usually very soon thereafter the Court will permit the property ow­ner  to withdraw nearly all of the amount deposited, provided his title is clear. What  percentage he can draw is disc retionary with the Court. The withdrawal does not in  any way prevent him from going ahead with his claim for more money for his property  than deposited in the Court. Inquiries about withdrowols for cases in condemnation  should be sent to the U. S. Attorney, Post Office Building, Boise, Idaho.  14. WHAT FEDERAL INCOME TAXES DOES THE PROPERTY OWNER PAY  ON MONEY RECEIVED FROM THE UNITED STATES FOR HIS PROPERTY?  Responsibility for the administration of the Federal income tax laws rests  with the Inte rnal Revenue Service, DepartQ'lent of the Treasury . As presently written,  5 			2012-02-17	2012-02-17	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1160	1160	1161.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1161.pdfpage
Page 11																							..  ..  '  these lows contain special provisions with respect to gains derived from the sole  of real estate, including soles mode to the United States. It may be that the pro­perty  owner will not be obligated for income tax on such gain, especially if he  rebuilds or reinvests in similar or like property. Such questions concerning the  oppl icotion of these provisions should be token up with the local Director of Inter­nal  Revenue.  15. WHEN WILL THE BRUCE$ EDDY DAM AND RESERVOIR BE RAISED?  The Bruces Eddy Dam and Reservoir is scheduled to be raised in 1971.  16. WHERE WILL COUNTY HIGHWAY RELOCATIONS BE MADE?  See condensed reservoir map for brochure.  17. HOW IS THE VALUE OF PROPERTY ESTIMATED?  The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution provides that just compensa­tion  wi II be paid for taking private property for pub I ic use. However, since the  Constitution does not define 11 just compensation 11 the matter has been left to the  Federal Courts for definition. In establishing a practical standard for determining  just compensation the courts have adopted the concept of market value, which  generally has been defined as that amount which would probably be paid for pro­perty  as between a wi II ing seller and a wi II ing buyer. The courts also have laid  down criteria on which to base determination of market value. For example, that  price the particular property has been bought and sold for in the open market with­in  o reasonable time of the acquisition by the Government, or the recent selling  price of similar properties in the vicinity, ore recognized to be among the best in­dications  of value.  18. HOW MUCH WILL THE PROPERTY OWNER BE PAl D FOR HIS PROPER-TY?  The rights of a citizen are protected by the Fifth Amendment of the Con­stitution  of the United States which permits private property to be acquired for public  use provided that the property owner is paid 11 just compensation 11 for any of his pro-  6 			2012-02-17	2012-02-17	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1161	1161	1162.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1162.pdfpage
Page 12																							..  - perty taken. The Constitution does not define "just compensation." Neither ore  there general statutes which attempt to establish criteria upon which to base pay­ments  to property owners affected by pub I ic works projects. The determination of  "just compensation," therefore, is a judic ial question. The Federal courts have de­f  ined 11 just compensation 11 as "fa ir ma1 ket value. " It is the Corps' desire and duty  to pay the property owner "just compensation. 11  19. NEGOTIATIONS  To avoid litigation and relieve congestion in the courts, Congress re­cently  enacted o low to facilitate the procedure by which owners and the Corps can  reach agreement fol the purchase of land. Section 301, Public Law 86-645, approv­ed  14 July 1960, known as "Land Acquisition Pol icy Act of 1960 11  1 as interpreted  by the Assistant Attorney General established o policy that the Corps land negoti­ators  will engage in actual, practical and realistic negotiations to the same extent  as is the p1actice normally between willing buyers and willing sellers in an effort to  acquire property at a price considered just and reasonable. This in no way negated  the importance of appraisals, prepared by professional appraisers, as being the basis  for settlements. However , it often will permit conclusions of transactions which  might otherwise have to be condemned, which could be costly to both the owner  and the Government. This law is not authority for the Corps to pay amounts which  are not just and reasonable.  20. HOW LONG WILL THE PROPERTY OWNER BE PERMITTED TO REMAIN  ON THE PROPERTY AFTER PAYMENT IS MADE AND THE UNITED STATES ACQUIRES  TITLE?  This depends upon the Corps' schedule for use of the property. In the  case of residential property, the owner may reserve up to a year's rent free occupan­cy  with reasonable rental thereafter. On agricultural properties reservation of pos­session  to harvest crops can be arranged with rental to begin the next crop year. On  commercial property rental from the Government begins when title passes. These pro-  7 			2012-02-17	2012-02-17	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1162	1162	1163.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1163.pdfpage
Page 13																							)  cedures permit former owners or tenants to stay on the property for a period to be  agreed upon. Thereafter, the possibility of remaining on the property will depend  on the Corps' plans for the use of the property.  21 . HOW MUCH RENTAL WILL BE REQUIRED BY THE CORPS FROM FOR-MER  PROPERTY OWNERS WHO WISH TO REMAIN ON PROPERTY AFTER PROPER­TY  IS PURCHASED BY THE CORPS?  The rental figure will be based on the current rentals of private pro­perties  in the area and each such rental will be negotiated on an individual basis.  Generally these rates are very reasonable, especially if the owner reserves his  buildings for off- site removal so only land rental values ore involved.  OTHER QUEST IONS  There ore undoubtedly numerous questions yet to be answered. These ques­tions  will vary from ownership to ownership and will require answers on an individ­ual  basis.  It is recognized that various, and often conflicting, rumors may arise regard­ing  the acquisition of property. The property owner may be sure, however, that he  will be officially notified at on early dote when action is to be token on his par­ticular  ownership. In the meantime, and until he has received such official not­ification,  he should continue to use or operate his property in a normal manner.  For additional information and procedures in connection with property acqui­sition,  property owners and tenants are invited to write or contact the U. S. Army  Engineer District, Walla Walla, Corps of Engineers, Real Estate Division, Building  602, City- County Airport, Walla Walla, Washington. A prompt and courteous  reply to every inquiry will be made.  8 			2012-02-17	2012-02-17	http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/dworshak/id/1163	1163	1164.pdfpage	/dworshak/image/1164.pdfpage
