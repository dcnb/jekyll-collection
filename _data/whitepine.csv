Tow path right, foreground. Path made of logs and puncheon smoothed with foot adz. Straight line in the center of the path is probably a decking line to enable the logs to be decked by a cross haul arrangement. Small """"cats"""" (tractors) used to tow logs. About the first use of cats for this purpose. Note that the chute (last two logs on left) has been laid almost flat as was usual when logs were going to be decked at the landing. This made it easier for the peavey man to roll the logs onto the deck. Chute went to the last deck in the background on the left.
