Transcript begins with a 'guide' pontificating and Robinson interrupts by using the term 'misfit' to describe those who have not found the God-Power. He uses the metaphor of a ship lost at sea, not knowing where the ports are, to discuss life without direction like the God-Power and happiness. Robinson uses student testimonials. This typescript is heavily edited in pencil."

Robinson describes a scene in a city without life, where all things would stop if Life didn't exist, and deduces that you (speaking to the reader) are life now. He stresses the importance of the temporal and the God-Law happening now, on earth. Robinson criticizes orthodox religions for doctrines that prevent people from knowing anything about Life until they die."
