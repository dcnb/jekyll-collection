            "Small towns in Idaho's Butte, Custer, and Lemhi counties face particular challenges because of their rugged remoteness and also because of the area's biggest, most famous employer--the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) near Arco. This publication examines 19 sectors contributing to the three counties' economies, including INL and its contractors. It helps local planners and elected officials understand how to think about INL. While big and important, INL doesn't impact the tri-county economies as much as it would if a greater percentage of INL employees lived in the area instead of commuting from Idaho Falls, etc. How should local leaders respond? This report offers some ideas."
