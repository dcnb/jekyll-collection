    <description>Typescript begins with a quote from Dr. Jean S. Milner's book The Sky is Red, demanding a renewal of the human spirit through contact with the 'Great Spirit.'

    <description>In this lecture, meant to be read and not presented, Robinson claims everything he did before discovering the God-Law and Realm of God ended in failure. He uses examples, such as birds mating and geese flying in a 'V,' to prove there is an ancient force we can tap into, and that he did, to find success. This copy of the lecture is printed in a booklet entitled 'Psychiana (The Teaching Which Is Bringing New Life to a Spiritually Dead World)' and numbered 'Lecture No. 2'.</description>

    <title>Psychiana Untitled radio transcription</title>
    <description>Radio transcript on Psychiana teachings. Transcript begins by using bird migration as an example that there is a law, the God-Law, that governs nature. Announcer then reads a letter about electricity and radio being discovered but always existing. Robinson replies with a lecture about inventors like Edison and the discovery of forces that always existed for all time as proof of the God-Law.</description>

    <title>Radio Psychiana - Series for Dr. Frank B. Robinson No. 4</title>
    <description>Transcript of a fifteen minute radio broadcast on various themes. Transcript begins with a 'guide' pontificating and Robinson interrupts by using the term 'misfit' to describe those who have not found the God-Power. He uses the metaphor of a ship lost at sea, not knowing where the ports are, to discuss life without direction like the God-Power and happiness. Robinson uses student testimonials. This typescript is heavily edited in pencil.</description>

    <title>Psychiana - Dancing Flashes of Power</title>
    <description>Form Letter speaks of the God-Power often in metaphorical terms--i.e. as the surging of waves--that can move through a person. Robinson appeals to those who have felt weak in their lives and would like to have the happiness of those they see enjoying life around them. He offers this through Psychiana and primarily the God-Power, which he states is located inside them.</description>

    <description>Lesson discusses relationship between science and the Bible as they pertain to the story of creation. Robinson claims science and the Bible are not in opposition, but 'corroborate' or 'dovetail' each other. He discusses interpretation, and eventually creates a hierarchy of science over religion when the two clash (i.e. is it possible that the world was truly created in 6 days?).</description>

Robinson also discusses Jesus as the most qualified to reveal what god is and draws attention to poor translations of Jesus' words by average men: God is not 'a spirit' but that God 'is spirit.'

    <description>Lesson discusses the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and the moment of the Fall. Robinson uses to Fall not as humanity's decent into sin, but rather the point at which man's eyes opened to the physical world and closed to the spiritual world. This creates a 'senses veil' that does not allow people to see God as he works on earth among us. Robinson then encourages students to use their lesson time to sit quietly, concentrate, and talk directly to God.</description>

    <description>Advanced teaching lesson for students to become teachers of Psychiana and spread it to others. Lesson prompted by an explosion that killed '450 - 500' school children in Texas (though this lesson is dated 1936, Robinson refers to the New London School Explosion on March 18, 1937 in New London, Texas in which 295 of the original 425 reported died). Robinson uses this incident to draw lines between what religions call 'the will of god' and laws of nature.</description>

    <title>Why I Founded Psychiana</title>
    <description>Lesson begins with Robinson telling of his past and childhood home, specifically his upbringing in a Christian home and study of Christian texts. He then discusses his disillusionment with religion and the revelation of Psychiana that followed. He also discusses 'New Psychology,' its relationship with Christ's teachings, and the ability to get what you want in this life rather than waiting for the afterlife.</description>
